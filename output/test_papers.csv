MicroAdam: Accurate Adaptive Optimization with Low Space Overhead and Provable Convergence,"Ionut-Vlad Modoranu, Mher Safaryan, Grigory Malinovsky, Eldar Kurtic, Thomas Robert, Peter Richtárik, Dan Alistarh","We propose a new variant of the Adam optimizer called MicroAdam that specifically minimizes memory overheads, while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees. We achieve this by compressing the gradient information before it is fed into the optimizer state, thereby reducing its memory footprint significantly. We control the resulting compression  error via a novel instance of the classical error feedback mechanism from distributed optimization in which the error correction information is itself compressed to allow for practical memory gains. We prove that the resulting approach maintains theoretical convergence guarantees competitive to those of AMSGrad, while providing good practical performance. Specifically, we show that MicroAdam can be implemented efficiently on GPUs: on both million-scale (BERT) and billion-scale (LLaMA) models, MicroAdam provides practical convergence competitive to that of the uncompressed Adam baseline, with  lower memory usage and similar running time. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/MicroAdam.",https://papers.nips.cc//paper_files/paper/2024/hash/000f947dcaff8fbffcc3f53a1314f358-Abstract-Conference.html
GITA: Graph to Visual and Textual Integration for Vision-Language Graph Reasoning,"Yanbin Wei, Shuai Fu, Weisen Jiang, Zejian Zhang, Zhixiong Zeng, Qi Wu, James T. Kwok, Yu Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for various tasks with graph structures. Though LLMs can process graph information in a textual format, they overlook the rich vision modality, which is an intuitive way for humans to comprehend structural information and conduct general graph reasoning. The potential benefits and capabilities of representing graph structures as visual images (i.e., $\textit{visual graph}$) are still unexplored. To fill the gap, we innovatively propose an end-to-end framework, called $\textbf{G}$raph to v$\textbf{I}$sual and $\textbf{T}$extual Integr$\textbf{A}$tion (GITA), which firstly incorporates visual graphs into general graph reasoning. Besides, we establish  $\textbf{G}$raph-based $\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{Q}$uestion $\textbf{A}$nswering (GVLQA) dataset from existing graph data, which is the first vision-language dataset for general graph reasoning purposes. Extensive experiments on the GVLQA dataset and five real-world datasets show that GITA outperforms mainstream LLMs in terms of general graph reasoning capabilities. Moreover, We highlight the effectiveness of the layout augmentation on visual graphs and pretraining on the GVLQA dataset.",https://papers.nips.cc//paper_files/paper/2024/hash/00295cede6e1600d344b5cd6d9fd4640-Abstract-Conference.html
How does PDE order affect the convergence of PINNs?,"Changhoon Song, Yesom Park, Myungjoo Kang","This paper analyzes the inverse relationship between the order of partial differential equations (PDEs) and the convergence of gradient descent in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the power of ReLU activation. The integration of the PDE into a loss function endows PINNs with a distinctive feature to require computing derivatives of model up to the PDE order. Although it has been empirically observed that PINNs encounter difficulties in convergence when dealing with high-order or high-dimensional PDEs, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of this issue remains elusive. This paper offers theoretical support for this pathological behavior by demonstrating that the gradient flow converges in a lower probability when the PDE order is higher. In addition, we show that PINNs struggle to address high-dimensional problems because the influence of dimensionality on convergence is exacerbated with increasing PDE order. To address the pathology, we use the insights garnered to consider variable splitting that decomposes the high-order PDE into a system of lower-order PDEs. We prove that by reducing the differential order, the gradient flow of variable splitting is more likely to converge to the global optimum. Furthermore, we present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims.",https://papers.nips.cc//paper_files/paper/2024/hash/00532321a253959cedc4f971b5524131-Abstract-Conference.html
Fair Wasserstein Coresets,"Zikai Xiong, Niccolò Dalmasso, Shubham Sharma, Freddy Lecue, Daniele Magazzeni, Vamsi K. Potluru, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso","Data distillation and coresets have emerged as popular approaches to generate a smaller representative set of samples for downstream learning tasks to handle large-scale datasets. At the same time, machine learning is being increasingly applied to decision-making processes at a societal level, making it imperative for modelers to address inherent biases towards subgroups present in the data. While current approaches focus on creating fair synthetic representative samples by optimizing local properties relative to the original samples, their impact on downstream learning processes has yet to be explored.  In this work, we present fair Wasserstein coresets ($\texttt{FWC}$), a novel coreset approach which generates fair synthetic representative samples along with sample-level weights to be used in downstream learning tasks. $\texttt{FWC}$ uses an efficient majority minimization algorithm to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the original dataset and the weighted synthetic samples while enforcing demographic parity. We show that an unconstrained version of $\texttt{FWC}$ is equivalent to Lloyd's algorithm for k-medians and k-means clustering. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real datasets show that $\texttt{FWC}$:  (i) achieves a competitive fairness-performance tradeoff in downstream models compared to existing approaches, (ii) improves downstream fairness when added to the existing training data and (iii) can be used to reduce biases in predictions from large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4).",https://papers.nips.cc//paper_files/paper/2024/hash/005413e90d003d13886019607b037f52-Abstract-Conference.html
Improved Regret for Bandit Convex Optimization with Delayed Feedback,"Yuanyu Wan, Chang Yao, Mingli Song, Lijun Zhang","We investigate bandit convex optimization (BCO) with delayed feedback, where only the loss value of the action is revealed under an arbitrary delay. Let $n,T,\bar{d}$ denote the dimensionality, time horizon, and average delay, respectively. Previous studies have achieved an $O(\sqrt{n}T^{3/4}+(n\bar{d})^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret bound for this problem, whose delay-independent part matches the regret of the classical non-delayed bandit gradient descent algorithm. However, there is a large gap between its delay-dependent part, i.e., $O((n\bar{d})^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, and an existing $\Omega(\sqrt{\bar{d}T})$ lower bound. In this paper, we illustrate that this gap can be filled in the worst case, where $\bar{d}$ is very close to the maximum delay $d$. Specifically, we first develop a novel algorithm, and prove that it enjoys a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{n}T^{3/4}+\sqrt{dT})$ in general. Compared with the previous result, our regret bound is better for $d=O((n\bar{d})^{2/3}T^{1/3})$, and the delay-dependent part is tight in the worst case. The primary idea is to decouple the joint effect of the delays and the bandit feedback on the regret by carefully incorporating the delayed bandit feedback with a blocking update mechanism. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm can improve the regret bound to $O((nT)^{2/3}\log^{1/3}T+d\log T)$ for strongly convex functions. Finally, if the action sets are unconstrained, we demonstrate that it can be simply extended to achieve an $O(n\sqrt{T\log T}+d\log T)$ regret bound for strongly convex and smooth functions.",https://papers.nips.cc//paper_files/paper/2024/hash/00616a2d48f5716f3d6f783491149364-Abstract-Conference.html
