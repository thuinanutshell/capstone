# NeurIPS Research Analysis
This is a project developed out of curiosity about the research trends in AI and Machine Learning over the past 40 years. I scraped all 38 proceedings' research papers and their abstracts and employed some data analysis techniques, such as topic modeling and k-means clustering, to visualize semantically similar papers. Through this project, I want to answer the following questions:
- How has the landscape of AI/ML research changed over the past few years?
- What are some of the papers that stand the test of time or are being cited the most?
- Can we somehow predict what areas/topics of research worth pursuing based on past data?
