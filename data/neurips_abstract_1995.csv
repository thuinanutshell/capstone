Marshall, Richard K. Alley, Robert S. Hubbard","Visual  occlusion  events  constitute  a  major source  of depth  information.  This paper presents a self-organizing neural network that learns to detect,  represent,  and predict the visibility and invisibility relationships that arise  during  occlusion  events,  after  a  period  of exposure  to  motion sequences  containing occlusion  and  disocclusion events.  The  network develops  two  parallel opponent  channels  or  ""chains""  of lateral  excitatory  connections  for  every  resolvable  motion trajectory.  One  channel,  the  ""On""  chain or  ""visible""  chain, is  activated when a moving stimulus is visible.  The other  channel, the  ""Off""  chain or  ""invisible""  chain,  carries  a persistent,  amodal  representation that predicts the motion of a formerly visible stimulus that  becomes  invisible  due  to occlusion.  The  learning  rule  uses  disinhibition  from  the  On  chain  to  trigger  learning  in  the  Off  chain.  The  On  and  Off chain  neurons  can  learn  separate  associations  with  object  depth  or(cid:173) dering.  The results  are closely  related  to the  recent  discovery  (Assad  &  Maunsell,  1995)  of neurons in macaque monkey posterior  parietal cortex  that respond selectively to inferred  motion of invisible stimuli.

INTRODUCTION:  LEARNING ABOUT  OCCLUSION  EVENTS 
Visual  occlusion  events  constitute  a  major source  of depth  information.  Yet  lit(cid:173) tle  is  known  about  the  neural  mechanisms  by  which  visual  systems  use  occlusion  events  to infer  the  depth  relations  among visual objects.  What is  the structure  of  such  mechanisms?  Some possible  answers  to this question  are revealed  through  an  analysis of learning rules that can cause  such  mechanisms to self-organize. 
Evidence  from  psychophysics  (Kaplan,  1969;  Nakayama  &  Shimojo,  1992;  Nakayama,  Shimojo,  &  Silverman,  1989;  Shimojo,  Silverman,  &  Nakayama,  1988,  1989;  Yonas,  Craton,  &  Thompson,  1987)  and  neurophysiology  (Assad  &  Maunsell,  1995;  Frost,  1993)  suggests  that  the  process  of  determining  relative  depth  from  occlusion  events  operates  at  an early stage  of visual  processing.  Mar(cid:173) shall  (1991)  describes  evidence  that suggests  that the same early  processing  mech(cid:173) anisms maintain a representation of temporarily occluded objects for  some amount

of time after  they  have  disappeared  behind  an  occluder,  and  that  these  represen(cid:173) tations of invisible objects  interact  with other  object  representations,  in  much  the  same  manner  as  do  representations  of visible  objects.  The  evidence  includes  the  phenomena of kinetic subjective contours (Kellman & Cohen,  1984), motion viewed  through a slit (Parks' Camel)  (Parks,  1965) , illusory occlusion  (Ramachandran, In(cid:173) ada, & Kiama, 1986) , and interocular occlusion sequencing  (Shimojo, Silverman, &  Nakayama, 1988).  2  PERCEPTION OF OCCLUSION  AND 
DISOCCLUSION  EVENTS:  AN ANALYSIS 
The neural network model exploits the visual changes that occur at occlusion bound(cid:173) aries to form a mechanism for detecting and representing object visibility/invisibility  information.  The set of learning  rules  used  in  this model is  an extended  version  of  one  that has  been  used  before  to describe  the  formation of neural  mechanisms for  a  variety  of other  visual  processing  functions  (Hubbard  &  Marshall,  1994;  Mar(cid:173) shall,  1989,  1990ac,  1991,  1992;  Martin &  Marshall,  1993). 
Our  analysis  is  derived  from  the  following  visual  predictivity principle,  which 
may be postulated  as  a  fundamental principle  of neural organization in visual sys(cid:173) tems:  Visual  systems  represent the  world in  terms of predictions of its  appearance,  and they reorganize themselves  to generate  better predictions.  To maximize the cor(cid:173) rectness  and completeness of its predictions, a visual system  would  need  to predict  the motions and visibility/invisibility of all objects in a scene.  Among other things,  it would  need  to predict the disappearance of an object moving behind an occluder  and the reappearance  of an object emerging from  behind  an occluder. 
A  consequence  of this  postulate  is  that occluded  objects  must,  at  some  level, 
continue  to  be  represented  even  though  they  are  invisible.  Moreover,  the  repre(cid:173) sentation of an  object  must  distinguish  whether  the  object  is  visible  or  invisible;  otherwise, the visual system could not determine whether its representations predict  visibility  or  invisibility,  which  would  contravene  the  predictivity  principle.  Thus,  simple single-channel prediction schemes like the one  described  by  Marshall (1989,  1990a)  are inadequate to represent  occlusion  and disocclusion events.  3  A  MODEL FOR GROUNDED LEARNING TO 
PREDICT VISIBILITY AND  INVISIBILITY 
The initial structure  of the  Visible/Invisible network  model is  given  in  Figure  1A.  The network self-organizes in  response  to a  training regime containing many input  sequences  representing motion with and without occlusion and disocclusion events.  After  a  period  of self-organization,  the  specific  connections  that  a  neuron  receives  (Figure  1B)  determine whether it responds  to visible or invisible objects.  A neuron  that  responds  to  visible  objects  would  have  strong  bottom-up input  connections,  and it would  also have strong time-delayed lateral excitatory input connections.  A  neuron that responds selectively to invisible objects would  not have strong bottom(cid:173) up connections, but it would have strong lateral excitatory input connections.  These  lateral inputs would transmit to the neuron evidence that a previously visible object  existed.  The neurons  that respond  to invisible objects  must operate in  a  way  that  allows lateral  input  excitation  alone  to activate  the  neurons  supraliminally, in  the  absence of bottom-up input excitation from  actual visible objects.  4  SIMULATION OF A  SIMPLIFIED  NETWORK  4.1 
INITIAL  NETWORK STRUCTURE 
The  simulated  network,  shown  in  Figure  2,  describes  a  simplified  one(cid:173) dimensional  subnetwork  (Marshall  &  Alley,  1993)  of  the  more  general  two(cid:173) dimensional  network.  Layer  1  is  restricted  to  a  set  of motion-sensitive  neurons  corresponding  to one rightward motion trajectory. 
The  L+  connections  in  the  simulation  have  a  signal  transmission  latency  of  one  time unit.  Restricting  the lateral connections  to  a  single  time delay  and  to a  single direction limits the simulation to representing  a single speed  and direction of  motion; these results are therefore preliminary. This restriction reduced the number  of connections  and  made the simulation much faster.

A  corollary of the  theorem  is  that if the  tasks  are  known to  possess  a  common  inter(cid:173) nal  representation  or  preprocessing  then  the  number  of examples  required  per  task for  good generalisation  when learning n  tasks  si(cid:173) multaneously  scales  like  O(a + ~),  where  O(a)  is  a  bound  on  the  minimum  number  of examples  requred  to  learn  a  single  task,  and  O( a + b)  is  a  bound  on the  number  of examples  required  to  learn  each  task independently.

McCabe, Michael J. Denham","An essential feature of intelligent sensory processing is the ability to  focus on the part of the signal of interest against a background of  distracting signals, and to be able to direct this focus at will. In this  paper the problem of auditory scene segmentation is considered and a  model of the early stages of the process is proposed. The behaviour of  the model is shown to be in agreement with a number of well known  psychophysical results. The principal contribution of this model lies in  demonstrating how streaming might result from interactions between  the tonotopic patterns of activity of input signals and traces of previous  activity which feedback and influence the way in which subsequent  signals are processed."

1  A  BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE 11000  CHIP 
At Synaptics, we have created the 11000,  an analog VLSI chip that, when combined  with associated software, optically  reads  the E13B font  from  the bottom of checks.  This  E13B  font  is  shown  in  figure  1.  The  overall  architecture  of the  11000  chip  is  shown  in  figure  2.  The 11000  recognizes  checks  hand-swiped  through  a  slot.  A  lens  focuses  the image  of the bottom of the  check  onto the  retina.  The  retina has  circuitry  which  locates  the  vertical  position  of the  characters  on  the  check .  The  retina then  sends  an  image  vertically  centered  around  a  possible  character  to  the  classifier.  The classifier  in  the nooo  has  a  tough job.  It  must  be  very accurate  and immune  to  noise  and ink scribbles  in  the input .  Therefore , we  decided  to use  an  integrated  segmentation  and  recognition  approach  (Martin  &  Pittman,  1992)(Platt,  et  al.,  1992).  When the classifier produces a  strong response,  we  know  that a  character is  horizontally  centered in  the retina.

N. Rao, Gregory J. Zelinsky, Mary M. Hayhoe, Dana H. Ballard","Visual cognition depends criticalIy on the ability to make rapid eye movements  known as saccades that orient the fovea over targets of interest in a visual  scene. Saccades are known to be ballistic: the pattern of muscle activation  for foveating a prespecified target location is computed prior to the movement  and visual feedback is precluded. Despite these distinctive properties, there  has been no general model of the saccadic targeting strategy employed by  the human visual system during visual search in natural scenes. This paper  proposes a model for saccadic targeting that uses iconic scene representations  derived from oriented spatial filters at multiple scales. Visual search proceeds  in a coarse-to-fine fashion with the largest scale filter responses being compared  first. The model was empirically tested by comparing its perfonnance with  actual eye movement data from human subjects in a natural visual search task;  preliminary results indicate substantial agreement between eye movements  predicted by the model and those recorded from human subjects."

In this paper we present simulation results showing how  interactions between the place and head direction systems can account for  recent observations about hippocampal  place cell  responses to doubling  and/or rotation of cue cards in a cylindrical arena (Sharp et at.,  1990). 
Rodents have multiple internal representations of their relationship to their environment.  They  have,  for example,  a representation of their location (place cells in  the hippocampal  formation,  see  Muller  et  at.,  1991),  and  a  location-independent representation  of their  heading  (head  direction  cells  in  the  postsubiculum and  the  anterior thalamic  nuclei,  see  Taube et at.,  1990; Taube,  1995).  If these  representations  are  to  be  used  for  navigation, they  must  be  aligned  consistently  whenever the animal reenters a familiar environment.  This process was examined in a set  of experiments by Sharp et at.  (1990).

1  HEAD-DIRECTION CELLS  As a rat navigates through space, neurons called head-direction celis encode the animal's  directional  heading in the horizontal plane (Ranck,  1984; Taube, Muller, &  Ranck,  1990).  Head-direction cells have been  recorded in  several  brain areas, including the postsubicu(cid:173) lum (Ranck,  1984) and anterior thalamus (Taube,  1995).  A  variety of theories  have pro(cid:173) posed  that  head-direction  cells  might  play  an  important  role  in  spatial  learning  and  navigation  (Brown  &  Sharp,  1995;  Burgess,  Recce,  &  O'Keefe,  1994;  McNaughton,  Knierim, &  Wilson,  1995; Wan, Touretzky, &  Redish,  1994; Zhang,  1995).

This  method is  based  on an analogy to a  physical model;  the  ferromagnetic  Potts model  at thermal equilibrium is  used  as an analog computer for  this hard  optimization problem .  We  do not  assume  any structure  of the  un(cid:173) derlying distribution of the data.  Phase space of the Potts model is  divided  into  three  regions; ferromagnetic,  super-paramagnetic and  paramagnetic phases.  The  region  of interest  is  that  corresponding  to the super-paramagnetic one, where  domains of aligned spins ap(cid:173) pear.  The range of temperatures  where  these structures  are  stable  is  indicated  by  a  non-vanishing magnetic susceptibility.  We  use  a  very  efficient  Monte  Carlo  algorithm  to  measure  the  susceptibil(cid:173) ity  and  the  spin  spin  correlation  function.  The  values  of the  spin  spin  correlation  function,  at  the  super-paramagnetic  phase,  serve  to identify the  partition of the  data points into clusters. 
Many natural phenomena can be viewed as optimization processes,  and the drive to  understand and analyze them yielded powerful  mathematical methods.  Thus when  wishing to solve a hard optimization problem, it may be advantageous to apply these  methods  through  a  physical  analogy.  Indeed,  recently  techniques  from  statistical  physics  have  been  adapted for  solving hard optimization problems  (see  e.g.  Yuille  and Kosowsky,  1994).  In  this work  we formulate the problem of clustering in  terms  of a  ferromagnetic  Potts spin  model.  Using  the  Monte  Carlo method  we  estimate  physical quantities such  as the spin spin correlation function  and the susceptibility,  and  deduce from them the  number of clusters  and cluster  sizes.  Cluster  analysis  is  an  important technique  in exploratory  data analysis  and  is  ap(cid:173) plied in a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines.  The problem of partitionaZ  clustering can  be formally stated  as  follows.  With everyone of i  =  1,2, ... N  pat(cid:173) terns  represented  as  a  point  Xi  in  a  d-dimensional  metric  space,  determine  the  partition  of these  N  points  into  M  groups,  called  clusters,  such  that  points  in  a  cluster are more similar to each other than to points in different  clusters.  The value  of M  also has  to be  determined. 
Clustering Data  through  an  Analogy  to  the Potts  Model 
417 
The  two  main approaches  to partitional clustering  are  called  parametric and  non(cid:173) parametric.  In  parametric approaches  some knowledge of the  clusters'  structure  is  assumed  (e.g .  each  cluster  can  be  represented  by  a  center  and  a  spread  around  it) .  This assumption is  incorporated in a  global  criterion.  The goal is  to assign  the  data points so  that  the  criterion  is  minimized .  A  typical example is  variance  min(cid:173) imization (Rose, Gurewitz,  and  Fox,  1993) .  On  the other hand,  in  non-parametric  approaches  a  local  criterion is  used  to  build  clusters  by  utilizing local  structure  of  the  data.  For  example,  clusters  can  be formed  by  identifying high-density  regions  in  the  data space  or  by  assigning a  point  and its  K -nearest  neighbors  to the same  cluster.  In  recent  years  many  parametric  partitional  clustering  algorithms rooted  in statistical physics  were  presented  (see  e.g.  Buhmann and  Kiihnel  , 1993).  In the  present  work  we  use  methods of statistical physics  in non-parametric clustering. 
Our  aim is  to  use  a  physical  problem as  an analog to  the  clustering  problem.  The  notion of clusters  comes very  naturally in  Potts spin models  (Wang and Swendsen,  1990) where clusters are closely related to ordered regions of spins.  We place a Potts  spin variable Si  at each point Xi  (that represents one of the patterns), and introduce  a  short  range  ferromagnetic  interaction  Jij  between  pairs of spins,  whose  strength  decreases  as  the inter-spin distance Ilxi - Xj""  increases.  The system is  governed by  the  Hamiltonian (energy function)

This paper shows  that  harmony  networks  do  not  work  in  the  following  sense:  they  construct  many outputs that are  not valid  parse  trees. 
In order to show  that the notion of systematicity is compatible with connectionism,  Paul  Smolensky,  Geraldine  Legendre  and  Yoshiro  Miyata  (Smolensky,  Legendre,  and  Miyata  1992;  Smolen sky  1993;  Smolen sky,  Legendre,  and  Miyata  1994)  pro(cid:173) posed a mechanism, ""Harmony Theory,""  by which connectionist models purportedly  perform  structure  sensitive  operations  without  implementing classical  algorithms.

The  model  consolidates  Robinson's  negative  feedback  model  with  Wyatt  and  Pola's  positive  feedback scheme, to produce a  smooth  pursuit  system  which  zero's  the  velocity  of a  target on  the  retina.  Furthermore,  the  system  uses  the  current eye  motion  as  a  predictor for  future  target  motion.  Analysis,  stability and biological correspondence of the system are discussed.  For  implementation  at  the  focal  plane,  a  local  correlation  based  visual  motion  detection  technique  is  used.  Velocity  measurements,  ranging  over 4 orders of magnitude with < 15%  variation, provides  the  input  to  the smooth pursuit system.  The  system  performed  successful  velocity  tracking for high contrast scenes.  Circuit design and performance of the  complete smooth pursuit system is presented."

Learning in layered neural networks refers  to the modification of internal parameters  {J} which specify the strength of the interneuron couplings, so  as  to bring the map  fJ  implemented  by  the  network  as  close  as  possible  to  a  desired  map  1.  The  degree  of success  is  monitored  through  the  generalization  error,  a  measure  of the  dissimilarity between  fJ  and 1.  Consider  maps from  an  N-dimensional  input  space e onto  a  scalar  (,  as  arise  in  the formulation of classification  and  regression  tasks.  Two-layer  networks  with  an  arbitrary  number of hidden  units  have  been  shown  to  be  universal  approximators  [1]  for  such  N-to-one  dimensional  maps.  Information about  the  desired  map i  is  provided  through  independent  examples (e, (1'),  with  (I'  =  i(e) for  all  p .  The  examples are used  to train  a student  network with  N  input units,  K  hidden  units,  and  a  single  linear  output  unit;  the  target  map  i  is  defined  through  a  teacher  network  of  similar  architecture  except  for  the  number  M  of hidden  units.  We  investigate  the  emergence  of generalization  ability  in  an  on-line  learning scenario  [2],  in  which  the  couplings  are  modified  after  the  presentation  of each  example so  as  to minimize the corresponding error.  The resulting changes in {J} are described  as  a  dynamical evolution; the  number of examples plays the role  of time.  In  this  paper  we  limit our  discussion  to  the  case  of the  soft-committee  machine  [2],  in  which  all  the  hidden  units  are  connected  to  the  output  unit  with  positive  couplings  of unit  strength,  and  only  the  input-to-hidden  couplings  are  adaptive.

The gain of the VOR (the ratio of eye to head rotation velocity)  is  typically around -1  when the eyes are focused on a distant target.  However, to  stabilize images accurately, the VOR gain must vary  with context (eye position,  eye vergence and head  translation).  We  first  describe  a  kinematic  model of the  VOR which relies solely on sensory information available from the semicircular  canals (head rotation), the otoliths (head translation), and neural correlates of eye  position and vergence angle.  We then propose a dynamical model and compare it  to the eye velocity responses measured in monkeys. The dynamical model repro(cid:173) duces the observed amplitude and time course of the modulation of the VOR and  suggests one way to combine the required neural signals within the cerebellum and  the brain stem.

INTRODUCTION:  TRAJECTORY LEARNING 
The  design  of artificial  neural  systems,  in  robotics  applications  and  others,  often  leads to the problem of constructing a recurrent neural network capable of producing  a particular trajectory, in the state space of its visible units.  Throughout evolution,  biological neural systems,  such  as  central  pattern generators,  have  also  been faced  with  similar  challenges.  A  natural  approach  to  tackle  this  problem  is  to  try  to  ""learn""  the  desired  trajectory,  for  instance  through  a  process  of trial  and  error  and  subsequent  optimization.  Unfortunately,  gradient descent  learning of complex  trajectories  in  amorphous  networks  is  unsuccessful.  Here,  we  suggest  a  possible  approach where  trajectories are realized,  in a  modular and hierarchical fashion,  by  combining simple oscillators.  In particular,  we  show  that  banks of oscillators have  universal approximation properties.

Both  algorithms are  easily  generalized  to  larger  neural  networks,  and the  generalization  of Gradient  Descent  is  the stan(cid:173) dard  back-propagation  algorithm.  In  this  paper  we  prove  worst(cid:173) case  loss  bounds  for  both  algorithms  in  the  single  neuron  case.  Since  local  minima make  it  difficult  to  prove  worst-case  bounds  for  gradient-based  algorithms,  we  must  use  a  loss  function  that  prevents  the  formation of spurious  local  minima.  We  define  such  a  matching  loss  function  for  any  strictly  increasing  differentiable  transfer  function  and  prove  worst-case  loss  bound  for  any  such  transfer  function  and  its  corresponding  matching loss.  For  exam(cid:173) ple,  the  matching loss  for  the  identity function  is  the  square  loss  and  the matching loss  for  the logistic sigmoid is  the entropic loss.  The different  structure  of the bounds for  the  two  algorithms indi(cid:173) cates that the new  algorithm out-performs Gradient Descent  when  the inputs contain a  large number of irrelevant components.

To estimate the parameters, a stably convergent learning rule  is  presented.  This algorithm has been proven to converge to the desired system trajectory  for  all  initial  conditions  and system inputs.  This technique can be used to  design  neural network models  which  are guaranteed to solve the trajectory  learning problem."

Introduction:  ""What""  and  ""Where""  In Vision 
It is  a  generally  accepted  fact  that  the  computations  of early  vision  are  massively  parallel operations,  i.e.,  applied in parallel to  all parts of the visual field.  This high  degree  of parallelism cannot be sustained in in~ermediate and higher  vision because  of the astronomical number of different possible combination of features.  Therefore,  it  becomes  necessary  to  select  only  a  part  of the  instantaneous  sensory  input  for  more  detailed  processing  and  to  discard  the  rest.  This is  the  mechanism of visual  selective  attention.

Control of Selective Visual  Attention:  Modeling the ""Where"" Pathway 
803 
It is  clear  that similar selection  mechanisms are  also  required  in  machine vision for  the  analysis of all but the simplest visual scenes.  Attentional mechanisms are slowly  introduced  in  this  field;  e.g. , Yamada and  Cottrell  (1995)  used  sequential scanning  by  a  ""focus  of attention""  in  the  context  of face  recognition.  Another  model  for  eye  scan  path  generation,  which  is  characterized  by  a  strong  top-down  influence,  is  presented  by  Rao and Ballard (this  volume).  Sequential scanning can be applied to  more abstract spaces, like the dynamics of complex systems in optimization problems  with  large numbers  of minima (Tsioutsias and  Mjolsness,  this  volume). 
Primate vision is  organized  along  two  major anatomical pathways.  One  of them  is  concerned  mainly  with  object  recognition.  For  this  reason ,  it  has  been  called  the  What- pathway;  for  anatomical  reasons ,  it  is  also  known  as  the  ventral  pathway.  The  principal  task  of the  other  major pathway  is  the  determination of the  location  of objects  and  therefore  it  is  called  the  Where  pathway  or,  again  for  anatomical  reasons,  the  dorsal  pathway. 
In  previous work  (Niebur &  Koch ,  1994), we  presented  a  model for  the  implement(cid:173) ation  of the  What  pathway.  The  underlying  mechanism  is  ""temporal  tagging:""  it  is  assumed  that  the  attended  region  of  the  visual  field  is  distinguished  from  the  unattended  parts  by  the  temporal  fine-structure  of the  neuronal  spike  trains.  We  have  shown  that  temporal tagging can  be  achieved  by  introducing  moderate  levels  of correlation 1  between  those  neurons  which  respond  to  attended stimuli. 
How  can  such  synchronicity  be  obtained?  We  have  suggested  a  simple,  neurally  plausible mechanism , namely common input to  all  cells  which  respond  to  attended  stimuli.  Such  (excitatory)  input will  increase  the  propensity  of postsynaptic cells  to  fire  for  a  short  time  after  receiving  this  input,  and thereby  increase  the  correlation  between  spike  trains  without  necessarily  increasing  the  average  firing  rate . 
The subject  of the  present  study  is  to  provide  a  model of the  control system which  generates  such  modulating  input.  We  will  show  that  it  is  possible  to  construct  an  integrated  system  of  attentional  control  which  is  based  on  neurally  plausible  elements  and  which  is  compatible with  the  anatomy and  physiology of the  primate  visual system .  The system scans  a  visual Scene  and identifies its most salient parts.  A  possible task would  be  ""Find all  faces  in this image.""  We  are confident  that this  model  will  not  only  further  our  understanding  of the  function  of biological  vision  but  that it will  also  be  relevant for  technical  applications. 
2  A  Simple Model of The Dorsal  Pathway 
2.1  Overall Structure 
Figure  1 shows  an  overview  of the  model  Where  pathway.  Input  is  provided  in  the  form  of digitized  images from  an  NTSC  camera which  is  then  analyzed  in  various  feature  maps.  These maps are organized around the known operations in early visual  cortices.  They  are  implemented at different  spatial scales  and in  a  center-surround  structure  akin to  visual receptive  fields .  Different  spatial scales  are  implemented as  Gaussian pyramids (Adelson, Anderson , Bergen,  Burt,  &  Ogden,  1984).  The center 
1 In  (Niebur,  Koch,  &  Rosin,  1993),  a  similar  model  was  developed  using  periodic  ""40Hz""  modulation.  The  present  model  can  be  adapted  mutatis  mutandis  to  this  type  of modulation.

of the  receptive  field  corresponds  to  the  value  of a  pixel  at  level  n  in  the  pyramid  and  the  surround to  the  corresponding  pixels  at level  n + 2,  level  0 being  the  image  in normal size.  The features  implemented so far are  the  thr~e principal components  of  primate  color  vision  (intensity,  red-green,  blue-yellow),  four  orientations,  and  temporal change.  Short  descriptions  of the  different  feature  maps are presented  in  the  next  section  (2.2). 
We  then  (section  2.3)  address  the  question  of the  integration  of  the  input  in  the  ""saliency map,""  a  topographically organized map which codes for  the instantaneous  conspicuity  of the  different  parts of the visual field ."

The specialization is carried out by a prior ""investment learning stage"",  during which the system acquires a set of basis mappings or ""skills"" for  a  set of prototypical contexts.  Adaptation  of a ""skill"" to a new context  can then be achieved by interpolating in the space of the basis mappings  and thus can be extremely rapid.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
Imagine an agent acting in some environment.  At time t, the environment is in some  state Xt  chosen from  a finite set of states.  The agent perceives Xt,  and is  allowed to  choose an action at from  some finite  set of actions.  The environment then changes  state,  so  that  at  time  (t + 1)  it  is  in  a  new  state  Xt+1  chosen  from  a  probability  distribution which depends only on  Xt  and at.  Meanwhile,  the agent experiences a  real-valued cost  Ct,  chosen  from  a  distribution  which  also  depends  only  on  Xt  and  at  and which  has finite  mean and variance. 
Such  an environment is  called  a  Markov  decision  process,  or MDP.  The reinforce(cid:173) ment learning problem is  to control an MDP  to minimize the expected discounted  cost  Lt ,tCt  for  some  discount  factor,  E  [0,1].  Define  the  function  Q  so  that  Q(x, a)  is  the cost for  being in state x  at time  0,  choosing action a,  and behaving  optimally from  then on.  If we  can discover Q,  we  have solved the problem:  at each  step,  we  may simply choose at  to minimize Q(xt, at).  For more information about  MDPs, see  (Watkins,  1989, Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis,  1989).  We  may distinguish two classes of problems, online and offline.  In  the offline  prob(cid:173) lem,  we have a full  model of the MDP: given a state and an action, we  can describe  the  distributions  of the  cost  and  the  next  state.  We  will  be  concerned  with  the  online problem, in which our knowledge of the MDP is  limited to what we  can dis(cid:173) cover by  interacting with it.  To solve an online problem,  we  may approximate the  transition  and  cost functions,  then  proceed  as for  an offline  problem  (the indirect  approach);  or  we  may  try  to  learn  the Q  function  without  the  intermediate  step  (the direct approach).  Either approach may work better for  any given problem:  the

Stevens, Anthony M. Zador","While  it  is  generally  agreed  that  neurons  transmit  information  about their synaptic inputs through spike trains, the code by which  this  information is  transmitted  is  not  well  understood.  An  upper  bound  on  the  information  encoded  is  obtained  by  hypothesizing  that the precise  timing of each spike conveys information.  Here  we  develop  a  general  approach  to quantifying the information carried  by  spike  trains  under  this  hypothesis,  and  apply  it  to  the  leaky  integrate-and-fire  (IF)  model  of  neuronal  dynamics.  We  formu(cid:173) late  the  problem  in  terms  of the  probability  distribution  peT)  of  interspike  intervals  (ISIs),  assuming that  spikes  are  detected  with  arbitrary  but finite  temporal resolution .  In  the  absence  of added  noise,  all  the  variability in  the  ISIs  could encode  information, and  the  information rate  is  simply the entropy of the lSI  distribution,  H (T)  =  (-p(T) log2 p(T)},  times  the  spike  rate.  H (T)  thus  pro(cid:173) vides  an  exact  expression  for  the  information rate.  The  methods  developed  here  can be  used  to determine experimentally the infor(cid:173) mation carried  by  spike  trains,  even  when  the  lower  bound of the  information rate  provided  by  the  stimulus reconstruction  method  is  not  tight.  In  a  preliminary series  of experiments,  we  have  used  these  methods  to estimate information rates of hippocampal neu(cid:173) rons  in  slice  in  response  to somatic  current  injection.  These  pilot  experiments suggest  information rates as  high as  6.3  bits/spike.

Information rate of spike trains 
Cortical neurons use  spike  trains  to communicate with other  neurons.  The output  of each  neuron  is  a  stochastic function of its input from  the  other neurons.  It is  of  interest  to know  how  much each  neuron  is  telling other neurons about its inputs. 
How  much information does  the spike train provide about a signal?  Consider noise  net)  added  to  a  signal  set)  to  produce  some  total  input  yet)  =  set)  + net).  This  is  then  passed  through  a  (possibly  stochastic)  functional  F  to produce  the  output  spike  train  F[y(t)]  --+  z(t).  We  assume  that  all the  information contained  in  the  spike  train  can  be  represented  by  the  list  of spike  times;  that  is,  there  is  no extra  information contained in  properties  such  as spike  height or  width.  Note,  however,  that many characteristics of the spike  train such  as the mean or instantaneous rate 
76 
C. STEVENS, A.  ZADOR 
can be  derived  from  this  representation;  if such  a  derivative  property  turns  out  to  be  the relevant one,  then  this formulation can be specialized  appropriately. 
We  will  be  interested,  then,  in  the  mutual  information 1(S(t); Z(t»  between  the  input signal ensemble S(t) and the output spike train ensemble Z(t) . This is defined  in  terms  of the  entropy  H(S)  of the  signal,  the  entropy  H(Z)  of the  spike  train,  and  their joint entropy  H(S, Z), 
1(S; Z) =  H(S) + H(Z) - H(S, Z). 
(1)  Note that the mutual information is  symmetric, 1(S; Z) =  1(Z; S),  since  the joint  entropy  H(S, Z)  =  H(Z, S).  Note  also  that  if the  signal  S(t)  and  the  spike  train  Z(t)  are  completely independent,  then  the mutual information is  0,  since  the joint  entropy is just the sum of the individual entropies H(S, Z) = H(S) + H(Z).  This is  completely in lin'e  with our intuition, since  in  this case  the  spike  train  can  provide  no  information about the signal. 
Information estimation through stimulus reconstruction 
1.1  Bialek  and  colleagues  (Bialek  et  al.,  1991)  have  used  the  reconstruction  method  to  obtain  a  strict  lower  bound  on  the  mutual information in  an experimental set(cid:173) ting.  This method is  based on  an expression  mathematically equivalent  to eq.  (1)  involving the conditional entropy  H(SIZ) of the signal given the spike train,"

The model's opera(cid:173) tion involves prediction, but instead of predicting sensory input, it  directly regulates movement by reacting in an anticipatory fashion  to input patterns that include delayed sensory feedback."

On the one  hand,  this  scheme can be used for static data when some of the input variables are missing.  On  the  other  hand,  it can also  be  used  for  sequential  data,  when  some of the  input variables are missing or are available at different frequencies.  Unlike in the  case of probabilistic models (e.g.  Gaussian) of the missing variables, the network  does  not  attempt  to  model the  distribution  of the  missmg  variables given  the  observed variables.  Instead it is a  more ""discriminant"" approach that fills  in the  missing variables for  the sole purpose of minimizing a  learning criterion  (e.g.,  to  minimize an output error)."
