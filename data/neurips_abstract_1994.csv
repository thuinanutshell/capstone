Skaggs, James J. Knierim, Hemant S. Kudrimoti, Bruce L. McNaughton","In  the last decade  the outlines  of the neural  structures  subserving  the sense of direction have begun to emerge.  Several investigations  have shed  light on  the effects  of vestibular  input  and visual  input  on  the  head  direction  representation.  In  this  paper,  a  model  is  formulated of the neural mechanisms underlying the head direction  system.  The model is  built out of simple ingredients,  depending  on  nothing  more complicated than  connectional  specificity,  attractor  dynamics,  Hebbian  learning,  and  sigmoidal  nonlinearities,  but  it  behaves  in  a  sophisticated  way  and  is  consistent  with  most of the  observed properties ofreal head direction cells.  In addition it makes  a  number  of predictions  that  ought  to  be  testable  by  reasonably  straightforward experiments. 
1  Head  Direction  Cells  in  the Rat 
There  is  quite  a  bit  of  behavioral  evidence  for  an  intrinsic  sense  of  direction  in  many species  of mammals, including  rats  and  humans  (e.g.,  Gallistel,  1990).  The  first  specific  information regarding  the  neural  basis  of this  ""sense""  came with  the  discovery  by  Ranck  (1984)  of a  population  of  ""head  direction""  cells  in  the  dorsal  presubiculum (also known as the  ""postsubiculum"") of the rat.  A head direction cell

fires  at  a  high  rate  if and  only  if the rat's  head  is  oriented  in  a  specific  direction.  Many  things  could  potentially  cause  a  cell  to  fire  in  a  head-direction  dependent  manner:  what made the postsubicular  cells  particularly interesting  was  that when  their directionality was tested with the rat at different locations, the head directions  corresponding to maximal firing  were  consistently parallel, within the experimental  resolution.  This  is  difficult  to  explain  with  a  simple sensory-based  mechanism;  it  implies something more sophisticated.1 
The  postsubicular  head  direction  cells  were  studied  in  depth  by  Taube  et  al.  (1990a,b),  and,  more  recently,  head  direction  cells  have  also  been  found  in  other  parts of the rat brain,  in  particular  the anterior nuclei  of the  thalamus (Mizumori  and  Williams,  1993)  and  the  retrosplenial  (posterior  cingulate)  cortex  (Chen  et  al.,  1994a,b).  Interestingly,  all  of these  areas  are  intimately  associated  with  the  hippocampal  formation,  which  in  the  rat  contains  large numbers  of  ""place""  cells.  Thus,  the  brain  contains  separate  but  neighboring  populations  of cells  coding  for  location and  cells  coding for  direction,  which taken together  represent  much of the  information needed  for  navigation. 
Figure  1 shows  directional  tuning curves  for  three  typical head  direction cells from  the  anterior  thalamus.  In each  of them the  breadth  of tuning is  on the order of 90  degrees.  This value is  also typical for  head direction cells in the postsubiculum and  retrosplenial  cortex,  though  in  each  of the  three  areas  individual  cells  may  show  considerable variability. 
Figure  1:  Polar plots  of directional  tuning  (mean firing  rate  as  a  function  of head  direction)  for  three  typical head  direction  cells from the anterior thalamus of a  rat. 
Every study  to date has indicated that the head  direction cells  constitute a unitary  system,  together  with  the  place  cells  of  the  hippocampus.  Whenever  two  head  direction  cells  have  been  recorded  simultaneously,  any  manipulation  that  caused  one of them to shift its directional  alignment caused the other to shift by  the same  amount;  and  when  head  direction  cells  have  been  recorded  simultaneously  with  place  cells,  any  manipulation that caused  the head  direction  cells  to  realign either  caused  the hippocampal place fields  to rotate correspondingly or  to  ""remap"" into a  different  pattern  (Knierim  et  al.,  1995). 
Head direction cells  maintain their directional tuning for  some time when  the lights  in  the recording  room are  turned  off,  leaving  an  animal in  complete  darkness;  the  directionality tends to gradually drift, though, especially if the animal moves around  (Mizumori and Williams, 1993).  Directional tuning is preserved to some degree even

if an animal is  passively rotated in the dark, which indicates strongly that the head  direction system receives information (possibly indirect) from the vestibular system. 
Visual  input  influences  but  does  not  dictate  the  behavior  of head  direction  cells.  The  nature  of this  influence is  quite  interesting.  In  a  recent  series  of experiments  (Knierim  et  al.,  1995), rats were trained to forage for  food pellets in a gray cylinder  with  a  single salient  directional  cue,  a  white card  covering  90  degrees  of the  wall.  During  training,  half of the  rats were  disoriented  before  being  placed  in the  cylin(cid:173) der,  in  order  to  disrupt  the  relation  between  their  internal  sense  of direction  and  the  location  of the  cue  card;  the  other  half of the rats  were  not  disoriented.  Pre(cid:173) sumably,  the  rats  that were  not  disoriented  during  training  experienced  the same  initial relationship between their internal direction sense and the CUe card each time  they  were  placed  in  the  cylinder;  this  would  not have  been  true of the disoriented  rats.  Head  direction  cells  in  the  thalamus were  subsequently  recorded  from  both  groups of rats  as  they  moved  in  the cylinder.  All rats  were  disoriented  before  each  recording  session.  Under  these  conditions,  the  cue  card  had  much  weaker  control  over  the  head  direction  cells  in  the  rats  that had  been  disoriented  during training  than in  the  rats  that had not been  disoriented.  For  all rats the influence of the cue  card upon the head direction system weakened gradually over the course of multiple  recording  sessions,  and eventually they  broke free,  but this happened  much sooner  in  the rats  that had been  disoriented  during training.  The authors  concluded  that  a  visual  cue  could  only  develop  a  strong  influence  upon  the  head  direction  system  if  the  rat  experienced  it  as  stable. 
Figure 2 illustrates the shifts in  alignment during a typical recording session.  When  the  rat  is  initially placed  in  the  cylinder,  the  cell's  tuning  curve  is  aligned  to  the  west.  Over the first few  minutes of recording it gradually rotates to SSW, and there  it stays.  Note  the  ""tail"" of the curve.  This comes from spikes belonging to another,  neighboring head  direction cell, which could  not be perfectly isolated from the first.  Note that, even though they come from different cells,  both portions shift alignment  synchronously.

Sejnowski",Diagnosis of human disease or machine fault is a missing data problem  since many variables are initially unknown. Additional information needs  to be obtained. The j oint probability distribution of the data can be used to  solve this problem. We model this with mixture models whose parameters  are estimated by the EM algorithm.  This gives the benefit that missing  data in the database itself can also be handled correctly.  The request for  new information to refine the diagnosis is performed using the maximum  utility  principle.  Since  the  system  is  based  on  learning  it  is  domain  independent and less labor intensive than expert systems or probabilistic  networks.  An example using a heart disease database is presented.

Feed-forward artificial neural networks used for nonlinear regression can be interpreted as  predicting the  mean of the  target distribution as  a function  of (conditioned on)  the  input  pattern (e.g., Buntine & Weigend, 1991; Bishop, 1994), typically using one linear output unit  per output variable.

viewed as an error model (Rumelhart et al.,  1995).  Here, we present a simple method that  provides higher-order information about the cm than simply the mean.  Such additional  information could come from  attempting  to  estimate  the  entire cm with  connectionist  methods (e.g., ""Mixture Density Networks,"" Bishop, 1994; ""fractional binning, ""Srivastava  & Weigend,  1994) or with non-connectionist methods such as  a Monte Carlo on a hidden  Markov model (Fraser & Dimitriadis, 1994). While non-parametric estimates of the shape  of a  C1D require large quantities of data,  our less data-hungry method (Weigend & Nix,  1994) assumes a specific parameterized form of the C1D (e.g., Gaussian) and gives us the  value of the error bar (e.g., the width of the Gaussian) by finding those parameters which  maximize the likelihood that the target data was generated by a particular network model.  In this paper we derive the specific update rules for the Gaussian case.  We  would like to  emphasize, however, that any parameterized unimodal distribution can be used for the em  in the method presented here.

Specifically,  we  suggest that the anteriorforebrain pathway, which is not needed for song  production  in  the  adult  but is  essential  for  song  acquisition,  provides  synaptic perturbations and adaptive evaluations for syllable vocalization  learning.

Computing  the exact bias and  variance curves  as  a function of the sample size  we  are able to quantitatively compare the effect of the combination  on the bias and variance separately, and thus on the expected  error  which  is  the sum of the  two.  Our exact  calculations,  demonstrate  that the combination of estimators is particularly useful  in the case  where the data set is small and noisy and the function to be learned  is  unrealizable.  For  large  data sets  the  single  estimator produces  superior  results.

We  propose  an  alternative  approach  to  spatial  perception  of objects  in  the  pari(cid:173) etal  cortex from  the  perspective  of sensorimotor  transformations.  The responses of single parietal neurons can be modeled as  a gaus(cid:173) sian  function  of retinal  position  multiplied by  a  sigmoid function  of eye  position,  which  form  a  set of basis functions.  We  show  here  how  these  basis functions  can  be  used  to generate  receptive  fields  in  either  retinotopic or head-centered  coordinates by simple linear  transformations.  This raises the possibility that the parietal cortex  does  not  attempt to compute the positions of objects  in  a  partic(cid:173) ular  frame  of  reference  but  instead  computes  a  general  purpose  representation  of the retinal  location and eye  position from  which  any  transformation can  be  synthesized  by  direct  projection.

Subjects show recall of this  model  at testing  sessions  24  hours  after  the  initial practice.  The  representation  of the internal model in  memory is  such  that there  is  interference  when  there  is  an  attempt  to  learn  a  new  inverse  dynamics  map  immediately after  an  anticorrelated  mapping  was  learned.

The text people type  typically contains a tremendous amount of redundancy due to predictable  word  usage  patterns  and  the  text's  structure.  This  paper  describes  a  neural network system call AutoTypist that monitors a person's typing and  predicts what will be entered  next.  AutoTypist displays the most likely  subsequent word to the typist, who can accept it with a single keystroke,  instead of typing it in its entirety.  The multi-layer perceptron at the heart  of Auto'JYpist adapts its predictions of likely subsequent text to the user's  word usage pattern,  and to the characteristics of the text currently being  typed.  Increases in typing speed of 2-3% when typing English prose and  10-20% when typing C code have been demonstrated using the system,  suggesting a potential time savings of more than 20 hours per user per year.  In addition to increasing typing speed, AutoTypist reduces the number of  keystrokes a user must type by a similar amount (2-3% for English,  10- 20% for computer programs).  This keystroke savings has the potential to  significantly reduce the frequency  and severity of repeated stress injuries  caused by typing, which are the most common injury suffered in today's  office environment."

The  game  is a  Markov  Decision  Process  (MDP)  with continuous  time,  states, and actions, linear dynamics, and a quadratic cost function.  The  game consists of two players, a missile and a plane;  the missile pursues  the plane and  the plane evades the  missile.  The reinforcement learning  algorithm for optimal control is modified for differential games in order to  find the minimax point, rather than  the maximum.  Simulation results are  compared  to  the  optimal  solution,  demonstrating  that  the  simulated  reinforcement learning  system  converges  to  the optimal  answer.  The  performance of both the residual gradient and non-residual gradient forms  of advantage updating and Q-learning are compared.  The results show that  advantage  updating  converges faster  than  Q-learning in  all  simulations.  The results also show advantage updating converges regardless of the time  step duration; Q-learning is  unable to converge as the  time step duration  ~rows small.

1  ADVANTAGE  UPDATING 
The advantage updating algorithm (Baird, 1993) is a reinforcement learning algorithm in  which  two types  of information  are stored.  For each  state x, the  value V(x)  is  stored,  representing an estimate of the total discounted return expected when starting in  state x  and performing optimal actions.  For each state x and action u, the advantage, A(x,u), is  stored, representing  an  estimate of the  degree  to  which  the expected  total  discounted  reinforcement  is  increased  by  performing  action  u  rather  than  the  action  currently  considered best.  The optimal value function V* (x) represents the true value of each state.  The optimal advantage function A * (x,u)  will be zero if u is the optimal action (because u  confers no advantage relative to itself) and A * (x,u) will be negative for any suboptimal u  (because a suboptimal action has a negative advantage relative to  the best action).  The  optimal advantage function A * can be defined in terms of the optimal value function v*: 
A(x,u) = ~[RN(X,U)- V(x)+ rNV*(x')]"

This new version of  the  MLP  uses  a fundamental property of high dimensional spaces  which  allows  the  12-norm  to  be  accurately  approximated  by  the  It -norm.  This  approach  enables  the  standard  MLP  to  utilize  the  parallel architecture of the Ni1000 to achieve on the order of 40000,  256-dimensional classifications per second. 
1  The Intel NilOOO  VLSI Chip 
The Nestor/Intel radial basis function  neural chip (Ni1000) contains the equivalent  of  1024  256-dimensional  artificial  digital  neurons  and can  perform  at  least  40000  classifications  per  second  [Sullivan, 1993].  To attain  this  great  speed,  the  Ni1000  was  designed  to  calculate  ""city  block""  distances  (Le.  the  II-norm)  and  thus  to  avoid the large  number  of multiplication units that  would be required  to calculate  Euclidean dot  products in  parallel.  Each  neuron calculates the city block distance  between  its stored weights and the current  input: 
neuron  activity = L IWi  - :eil 
(1)  where  w,  is  the  neuron's stored  weight  for  the  ith  input  and  :ei  is  the  ith  input.  Thus the Nil000 is ideally suited to perform both the RCE [Reillyet al.,  1982]  and

However,  dot products are central in the calcula(cid:173) tions performed by most neural network algorithms (e.g.  MLP, Cascade Correlation,  etc.).  Furthermore, for  high dimensional data, the dot product becomes the compu(cid:173) tation bottleneck (i.e.  most ofthe network's time is spent calculating dot products).  If the  dot  product  can  not  be  performed in  parallel  there  will  be  little  advantage  using  the  NilOOO  for  such  algorithms.  In  this  paper,  we  address  this  problem  by  showing  that  we  can  extend  the  NilOOO  to  many of the  standard  neural  network  algorithms by  representing  the  Euclidean  dot  product  as  a  function  of Euclidean  norms and by then using a  city block norm approximation to the  Euclidean norm.

INTRODUCTION  AND  SUMMARY 
Statistical  models  of discrete  time series  have  a  wide  range  of applications,  most  notably to problems in speech  recognition  (Juang &  Rabiner,  1991)  and molecular  biology  (Baldi,  Chauvin,  Hunkapiller,  &  McClure,  1992).  A  common problem in  these  fields  is  to find  a  probabilistic  model,  and  a  set  of model  parameters,  that

account for sequences  of observed data.  Hidden  Markov models (HMMs)  have been  particularly successful  at  modeling discrete  time series.  One  reason  for  this  is  the  powerful learning rule (Baum) 1972») a special case of the Expectation-Maximization  (EM)  procedure  for  maximum likelihood  estimation  (Dempster)  Laird)  &  Rubin)  1977).  In  this  work)  we  develop  a  statistical  mechanical  framework  for  the  modeling  of  discrete  time series.  The framework  enables  us  to  relate  HMMs  to  a  large family  of exactly  solvable  models  in  statistical  mechanics.  The  connection  to  statistical  mechanics  was  first  noticed  by  Sourlas  (1989»)  who  studied  spin  glass  models  of  error-correcting  codes.  We  view  the  estimation procedure  for  HMMs  as  a  special  (and particularly tractable) case of the Boltzmann learning rule  (Ackley)  Hinton)  &  Sejnowski)  1985;  Byrne)  1992).  The rest of this paper is  organized as follows .  In Section 2)  we  review  the modeling  problem for  discrete  time series  and  establish  the  connection  between  HMMs  and  Boltzmann  machines.  In  Section  3)  we  show  how  to  quickly  determine  whether  or  not  a  particular  Boltzmann  machine  is  tractable)  and  if so)  how  to  efficiently  compute  the  correlations  in  the  Boltzmann  learning  rule.  Finally)  in  Section  4)  we  look  at  two  architectures  that  address  particular  weaknesses  of  HMMs:  the  modelling of disparate  time scales  and long-term dependencies. 
2  MODELING DISCRETE TIME SERIES 
A discrete  time series is  a sequence of symbols {jdr=l in which each symbol belongs  to a finite countable set)  i.e.  jl E {1) 2)  .. . ) m}.  Given one long sequence)  or perhaps  many shorter ones)  the  modeling task is  to characterize  the probability distribution  from which  the time series  are generated.

The sequence  of states  {idr=l  and symbols {jdr=l is  modeled to occur  with probability

The  modeling problem is  to find  the  parameter  values  (ajj' , bij ) 7I'j)  that maximize  the  likelihood  of observed  sequences  of training  data.  We  will  elaborate  on  the  learning  rule  in  section  2.3)  but first  let  us  make  the  connection  to  a  well-known  family of stochastic  neural networks, namely Boltzmann machines.

A  fundamental  feature  of  cortical  architecture  is  its  columnar  organization,  mani(cid:173) fested  in  the tendency  of neurons  with similar properties to be organized  in  columns  that run perpendicular to the cortical surface.  This organization of the cortex was ini(cid:173) tially discovered  by  physiological experiments  (Mouncastle,  1957;  Hubel  and  Wiesel,  1962),  and  subsequently  confirmed  with  the  demonstration  of histologically  defined  columns.  Tracing  experiments  have  shown  that  axonal  projections  throughout  the  cerebral  cortex tend to be organized in  vertically  aligned  clusters  or patches.  In  par(cid:173) ticular,  intrinsic  horizontal  connections  linking neighboring  cortical sites,  which  may  extend  up  to  2 - 3  mm,  have  a  striking tendency  to  arborize  selectively  in preferred  sites,  forming  distinct  axonal patches  200 - 300  J.lm  in  diameter. 
Recently,  it  has  been  observed  that  the  size  of  these  patches  matches  closely  the  average  diameter  of  individual  dendritic  arbors  of  upper-layer  pyramidal  cells

1 ACTIVE LEARNING - BACKGROUND 
An active learning problem is one where the learner has the ability or need to  influence or select its own training data. Many problems of great practical interest  allow active learning, and many even require it.  We consider the problem of actively learning a mapping X - Y based on a set of  training examples {(Xi,Yi)}~l' where Xi E X and Yi E Y. The learner is allowed  to iteratively select new inputs x (possibly from a constrained set), observe the  resulting output y, and incorporate the new examples (x, y) into its training set.  The primary question of active learning is how to choose which x to try next.  There are many heuristics for choosing x based on intuition, including choosing  places where we don't have data, where we perform poorly [Linden and Weber,  1993], where we have low confidence [Thrun and Moller, 1992], where we expect it 
706 
David Cohn, Zoubin Ghahramani, Michael I. Jordon 
to change our model [Cohn et aI, 1990], and where we previously found data that  resulted in learning [Schmidhuber and Storck, 1993].  In this paper we consider how one may select x ""optimally"" from a statistical  viewpoint. We first review how the statistical approach can be applied to neural  networks, as described in MacKay [1992] and Cohn [1994]. We then consider two  alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and  locally weighted regression. While optimal data selection for a neural network is  computationally expensive and approximate, we find that optimal data selection for  the two statistical models is efficient and accurate. 
2 ACTIVE LEARNING - A STATISTICAL APPROACH 
We denote the learner's output given input x as y(x). The mean squared error of  this output can be expressed as the sum of the learner's bias and variance. The  variance 0'3 (x) indicates the learner's uncertainty in its estimate at x. 1 Our goal  will be to select a new example x such that when the resulting example (x, y) is  added to the training set, the integrated variance IV is minimized: 
IV = J 0'3 P (x)dx. 
(1) 
Here, P(x) is the (known) distribution over X. In practice, we will compute a  Monte Carlo approximation of this integral, evaluating 0'3 at a number of random  points drawn according to P(x).  Selecting x so as to minimize IV requires computing 0-3, the new variance at x given  (x, y). Until we actually commit to an x, we do not know what corresponding y we  will see, so the minimization cannot be performed deterministically.2 Many learning  architectures, however, provide an estimate of PWlx) based on current data, so we  can use this estimate to compute the expectation of 0-3. Selecting x to minimize  the expected integrated variance provides a solid statistical basis for choosing new  examples.

Leen,"Ideally pattern recognition machines provide constant output when  the inputs are transformed under a group 9 of desired invariances.  These invariances can be achieved  by  enhancing the training data  to include examples of inputs transformed by elements of g,  while  leaving  the  corresponding  targets  unchanged.  Alternatively  the  cost  function  for  training  can  include  a  regularization  term  that  penalizes changes in the output when the input is  transformed un(cid:173) der the group. 
This paper relates the two approaches, showing precisely the sense  in  which  the regularized  cost function  approximates the result  of  adding  transformed (or distorted)  examples  to  the  training data.  The cost function for the enhanced training set is equivalent to the  sum of the original  cost function plus  a  regularizer.  For  unbiased  models,  the regularizer reduces  to the intuitively obvious choice - a  term that penalizes changes  in  the output when  the inputs are  transformed under  the  group.  For  infinitesimal  transformations,  the coefficient of the regularization term reduces to the variance of  the distortions introduced into the training data.  This correspon(cid:173) dence provides a simple bridge between the two  approaches."

Previous  investigators  have  suggested  that  these  cells  may represent  self-motion.  Spiral patterns  can  also  be  gener(cid:173) ated by the relative motion of the observer  and a particular object.

INTRODUCTION  AND  MOTIVATION 
1  Learning  from  examples is  a  common supervised  learning paradigm that  hypothe(cid:173) sizes a target concept given a stream of training examples that describes the concept.  In function  approximation,  example-based  learning can be formulated as synthesiz(cid:173) ing  an  approximation function  for  data sampled from  an unknown  target function  (Poggio and Girosi,  1990). 
Active learning describes  a class of example-based learning paradigms that seeks out  new  training examples from specific regions of the input space,  instead of passively  accepting examples from some data generating source.  By  judiciously selecting ex-
594

amples instead of allowing for possible random sampling, active  learning techniques  can  conceivably  have  faster  learning  rates  and  better  approximation results  than  passive learning methods. 
This paper presents  a  Bayesian formulation for  active  learning within the function  approximation framework.  Specifically, here is the problem we  want to address:  Let  Dn  = {(Xi, Yi)li  = 1, ... , n}  be  a  set  of n  data points  sampled from  an  unknown  target function  g,  possibly in the presence  of noise.  Given  an  approximation func(cid:173) tion  concept  class,  :F,  where  each  f  E :F  has prior  probability P;:-[J],  one  can  use  regularization  techniques  to  approximate 9 from  Dn  (in  the  Bayes  optimal sense)  by  means  of a  function  9 E:F.  We  want  a  strategy  to  determine  at  what  input  location one  should  sample the next  data point,  (XN+l, YN+d,  in order  to  obtain  the  ""best""  possible Bayes optimal approximation of the unknown target function  9  with our concept  class  :F. 
The data sampling problem consists  of two  parts: 
1)  Defining  what  we  mean  by  the  ""best""  possible  Bayes  optimal  ap(cid:173) proximation of an  unknown  target  function.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  an  optimality criterion for  evaluating the  ""goodness""  of a  solution  with  respect  to an  unknown  target function. 
2)  Formalizing precisely  the  task  of determining where  in  input  space  to  sample  the  next  data  point.  We  express  the  above  mentioned optimality  criterion  as  a  cost  function  to  be  minimized,  and  the  task  of choosing  the  next  sample  as  one  of minimizing  the  cost  function  with  respect  to  the  input  space  location of the  next sample point. 
Earlier  work  (Cohn,  1991;  MacKay,  1992)  have  tried  to use similar optimal experi(cid:173) ment design (Fedorov, 1972) techniques to collect data that would provide maximum  information about  the  target function.  Our  work  differs  from  theirs  in several  re(cid:173) spects.  First, we  use  a  different,  and perhaps more general,  optimality criterion for  evaluating solutions to an unknown target function, based on a measure of function  uncertainty that incorporates both bias and variance components of the total output  generalization error.  In contrast,  MacKay  and Cohn use only  variance components  in  model  parameter space.  Second,  we  address  the  important sample  complexity  question,  i.e.,  does  the  active  strategy  require  fewer  examples  to  learn  the  target  to  the  same  degree  of uncertainty?  Our  results  are  stated  in  PAC-style  (Valiant,  1984).  After completion of this work,  we learnt that Sollich (1994) had also recently  developed  a  similar formulation  to  ours.  His  analysis  is  conducted  in  a  statistical  physics framework. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:  Section 2,  develops our active sampling  paradigm.  In Sections 3 and 4,  we  consider two classes  offunctions for  which active  strategies  are  obtained,  and  investigate  their  performance  both  theoretically  and  empirically. 
2  THE MATHEMATICAL  FRAMEWORK  In  order  to optimally select  examples for  a  learning  task,  one  should  first  have  a  clear notion of what  an  ""ideal""  learning goal is for  the task.  We can  then  measure  an example's utility in  terms of how  well  the example helps the learner achieve the 
Active  Learning for  Function  Approximation 
595 
goal,  and  devise  an  active sampling strategy  that selects  examples  with maximum  potential  utility.  In  this  section,  we  propose  one such  learning goal  - to  find  an  approximation function  g  E :F  that  ""best""  estimates  the  unknown  target  function  g.  We  then derive  an example utility cost  function for  the goal and finally  present  a  general procedure for  selecting  examples. 
2.1  EVALUATING  A  SOLUTION TO  AN  UNKNOWN  TARGET - THE EXPECTED  INTEGRATED  SQUARED DIFFERENCE 
Let 9  be the target function that we want to estimate by means of an approximation  function 9 E  :F.  If the  target function  9  were  known,  then one natural measure of  how  well  (or  badly)  g  approximates 9  would  be  the  Integrated  Squared  Difference  (ISD)  of the  two functions:"

Furthermore simulations of a  variety  of specific  mathematical models  for  networks of spiking neurons have shown  that temporal coding offers interesting  possibilities for  solving  classical  benchmark-problems such  as  associative  memory,  binding, and pattern segmentation (for an overview see Gerstner et al., 1992).  Some  aspects  of these  models have  also  been studied  analytically, but  almost nothing is  known about their computational complexity (see Judd and Aihara, 1993, for some  first  results  in  this  direction).

The all  optical network is feed-forward and is composed of thin layers of a Kerr(cid:173) type self focusing/defocusing nonlinear optical material. The training  method is derived from a Lagrangian formulation of the constrained  minimization of the network error at the output. This leads to a  formulation that describes training as a calculation of the distributed error  of the optical signal at the output which is then reflected back through the  device to assign a spatially distributed error to the internal layers. This  error is then used to modify the internal weighting values. Results from  several computer simulations of the training are presented, and a simple  optical table demonstration of the network is discussed.

1 KERR TYPE MATERIALS 
Kerr-type optical networks utilize thin layers of Kerr-type nonlinear materials, in which the  index of refraction can vary within the material and depends on the amount of light striking  the material at a given location. The material index of refraction can be described by:  n(x)=no+nzI(x), where 110 is the linear index of refraction, ~ is the nonlinear coefficient, and  I(x) is the irradiance of a applied optical field as a function of position x across the material  layer (Armstrong, 1962). This means that a beam of light (a signal beam carrying  information perhaps) passing through a layer of Kerr-type material can be steered or  controlled by another beam of light which applies a spatially varying pattern of intensity  onto the Kerr-type material. Steering of light with a glass lens (having constance index of  refraction) is done by varying the thickness of the lens (the amount of material present) as  a function of position. Thus the Kerr effect can be loosely thought of as a glass lens whose  geometry and therefore focusing ability could be dynamically controlled as a function of  position across the lens. Steering in the Kerr material is accomplished by a gradient or  change in the material index of refraction which is created by a gradient in applied light  intensity. This is illustrated by the simple experiment in Figure 1 where a small weak probe  beam is steered away from a straight path by the intensity gradient of a more powerful pump  beam."

Andrew McCallum,"This paper presents instance-based state identification, an approach  to reinforcement learning and hidden state that builds disambiguat(cid:173) ing amounts of short-term memory on-line, and also learns with an  order of magnitude fewer training steps than several previous ap(cid:173) proaches. Inspired by a key similarity between learning with hidden  state and learning in continuous geometrical spaces, this approach  uses instance-based (or ""memory-based"") learning, a method that  has worked well in continuous spaces. 
1 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 
When a robot's next course of action depends on information that is hidden from  the sensors because of problems such as occlusion, restricted range, bounded field  of view and limited attention, the robot suffers from hidden state. More formally,  we say a reinforcement learning agent suffers from the hidden state problem if the  agent's state representation is non-Markovian with respect to actions and utility. 
The hidden state problem arises as a case of perceptual aliasing: the mapping be(cid:173) tween states of the world and sensations of the agent is not one-to-one [Whitehead,  1992]. If the agent's perceptual system produces the same outputs for two world  states in which different actions are required, and if the agent's state representation  consists only of its percepts, then the agent will fail to choose correct actions. Note  that even if an agent's state representation includes some internal state beyond its 
378 
R. Andrew McCallum 
immediate percepts, the agent can still suffer from hidden state if it does not keep  enough internal state to uncover the non-Markovian-ness of its environment. 
One solution to the hidden state problem is simply to avoid passing through the  aliased states. This is the approach taken in Whitehead's Lion algorithm [White(cid:173) head, 1992]. Whenever the agent finds a state that delivers inconsistent reward, it  sets that state's utility so low that the policy will never visit it again. The success  of this algorithm depends on a deterministic world and on the existence of a path  to the goal that consists of only unaliased states. 
Other solutions do not avoid aliased states, but do as best they can given a non(cid:173) Markovian state representation [Littman, 1994; Singh et al., 1994; Jaakkola et al.,  1995]. They involve either learning deterministic policies that execute incorrect  actions in some aliased states, or learning stochastic policies with action choice  probabilities matching the proportions of the different underlying aliased world  states. These approaches do not depend on a path of unaliased states, but they  have other limitations: when faced with many aliased states, a stochastic policy  degenerates into random walk; when faced with potentially harmful results from  incorrect actions, deterministically incorrect or probabilistically incorrect action  choice may prove too dangerous; and when faced with performance-critical tasks,  inefficiency that is proportional to the amount of aliasing may be unacceptable. 
The most robust solution to the hidden state problem is to augment the agent's  state representation on-line so as to disambiguate the aliased states. State identi(cid:173) fication techniques uncover the hidden state information-that is, they make the  agent's internal state space Markovian. This transformation from an imperfect state  information model to a perfect state information model has been formalized in the  decision and control literature, and involves adding previous percepts and actions to  the definition of agent internal state [Bertsekas and Shreve, 1978]. By augmenting  the agent's perception with history information-.short-term memory of past per(cid:173) cepts, actions and rewards-the agent can distinguish perceptually aliased states,  and can then reliably choose correct actions from them. 
Predefined, fixed memory representations such as order n Markov models (also  known as constant-sized perception windows, linear traces or tapped-delay lines)  are often undesirable. When the length of the window is more than needed, they  exponentially increase the number of internal states for which a policy must be  stored and learned; when the length of the memory is less than needed, the agent  reverts to the disadvantages of undistinguished hidden state. Even if the agent de(cid:173) signer understands the task well enough to know its maximal memory requirements,  the agent is at a disadvantage with constant-sized windows because, for most tasks,  different amounts of memory are needed at different steps of the task. 
The on-line memory creation approach has been adopted in several reinforcement  learning algorithms. The Perceptual Distinctions Approach [Chrisman, 1992] and  Utile Distinction Memory [McCallum, 1993] are both based on splitting states of a  finite state machine by doing off-line analysis of statistics gathered over many steps.  Recurrent-Q [Lin, 1993] is based on training recurrent neural networks. Indexed  Memory [Teller, 1994] uses genetic programming to evolve agents that use load and  store instructions on a register bank. A chief disadvantage of all these techniques  is that they require a very large number of steps for training.

However,  we often  have  high-level knowledge  about  the  learning problem.  In  optical character recognition  (OCR),  for  in(cid:173) stance, we know that the classification should be invariant under a set of  transformations like rotation or translation.  We propose a new modular  classification system based on several autoassociative multilayer percep(cid:173) trons which allows the efficient incorporation of such knowledge.  Results  are reported on the NIST database of upper case handwritten letters and  compared to other approaches to the invariance problem. 
1  INCORPORATION OF EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE 
The  aim  of supervised  learning is  to  learn  a  mapping  between  the  input and  the  output  space from  a  set of example pairs (input,  desired output).  The classical implementation  in the domain of neural networks is the backpropagation algorithm.  If this learning set is  sufficiently representative of the underlying data distributions, one hopes that after learning,  the system is able to generalize correctly to other inputs of the same distribution.

It  would  be  better to  have  more powerful techniques  to  incorporate knowledge  into  the  learning process  than  the choice of a set of examples.  The use  of additional knowledge  is  often limited  to  the  feature  extraction  module.  Besides  simple  operations  like  (size)  normalization,  we  can  find  more sophisticated  approaches  like  zernike  moments  in  the  domain of optical character recognition (OCR). In  this paper we  will  not investigate this  possibility, all discussed classifiers work directly on almost non preprocessed data (pixels). 
In the context of OCR interest focuses  on invariance of the classifier under a  number of  given transformations (translation, rotation, ... ) of the data to classify.  In general a neural  network could extract those properties of a large enough learning set, but it is very hard to  learn and will probably take a lot of time.  In the last years  two  main approaches for this  invariance problem have been proposed:  tangent-prop and tangent-distance.  An indirect  incorporation can be achieved by boosting (Drucker, Schapire and Simard, 1993). 
In this paper we briefly discuss these approaches and will present a new classification system  which allows the efficient incorporation of transformation invariances. 
1.1  TANGENT PROPAGATION 
The principle of tangent-prop is to specify besides desired outputs also desired changes jJJ.  of the output vector when transforming the net input x  by the transformations tJJ.  (Simard,  Victorri, LeCun and Denker, 1992).  For this, let us define a transformation of pattern p as t(p, a) : P  --t  P  where P  is the space  of all  patterns  and a  a parameter.  Such  transformations are in  general highly  nonlinear  operations in  the pixel space P  and their analytical expressions are  seldom known.  It is  therefore favorable to use a first order approximation:"

We  analyze a layered fully recurrent  architecture,  the  virtue  of this  architecture  is  that  it features  the  conventional  feedforward architecture as a special case.  A detailed description of  recursive  computation of the full  Hessian of the network cost func(cid:173) tion is  provided.

1  LEARNING IN RECURRENT NETWORKS 
Time  series  processing  is  an  important  application  area for  neural  networks  and  numerous architectures have been suggested, see e.g. (Weigend and Gershenfeld, 94).  The most general structure is a fully recurrent network and it may be adapted using  Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) suggested by  (Williams and Zipser,  89).  By  invoking a  recurrent  network,  the  length of the network memory can  be  adapted to  the  given  time series,  while  it is  fixed  for  the  conventional  lag-space net  (Weigend  et  al.,  90).  In  forecasting,  however,  feedforward  architectures  remain  the  most  popular structures; only few  applications are reported based on the Williams&Zipser  approach.  The main difficulties experienced  using  RTRL are slow  convergence  and

lack  of generalization.  Analogous  problems  in  feedforward  nets  are  solved  using  second  order  methods  for  training  and  pruning  (LeCun  et  al.,  90;  Hassibi  et  al.,  92;  Svarer  et  al.,  93).  Also,  regularization  by  weight  decay  significantly  improves  training and generalization.  In this work we initiate the investigation of second order  properties for  RTRL; a detailed  calculation scheme for  the cost function  Hessian  is  presented,  the importance of weight decay is demonstrated, and preliminary pruning  results  using Hassibi et al.'s Optimal Brain Surgeon  (OBS)  are presented.  We find  that the recurrent  network  discards  the  available lag space  and constructs  its own  efficient  internal memory. 
1.1  REAL  TIME RECURRENT  LEARNING 
The fully  connected  feedback  nets studied  by  Williams&Zipser operate like a  state  machine, computing the outputs from the internal units according to a state vector  z(t)  containing previous external inputs and internal unit outputs.  Let  x(t) denote  a  vector  containing the external  inputs  to  the net  at time t,  and let y(t)  denote  a  vector  containing the outputs of the  units  in  the  net.  We now  arrange  the  indices  on  x  and y  so  that the elements of z(t)  can be defined  as 
,  k  E I  ,  k E U 
where I  denotes the set of indices for which  Zk  is  an input, and U denotes  the set of  indices for  which  Zk  is  the output of a unit in the net.  Thresholds are implemented  using  an  input  permanently  clamped  to  unity.  The  k'th  unit  in  the  net  is  now  updated according to 
where Wkj  denotes the weight to unit k from input/unit j  and ""'0 is the activation  function  of the k'th unit.  When  used  for  time  series  prediction,  the  input  vector  (excluding  threshold)  is  usually defined  as  x(t) =  [x(t), . .. , x(t - L + 1)]  where  L denotes  the dimension of  the lag  space.  One of the units in the net is  designated to be the output unit Yo,  and  its activating function 10  is  often chosen  to be linear in order  to allow for  arbitrary  dynamical range.  The prediction of x(t + 1)  is x(t + 1)  = lo[so(t»).  Also,  if the first  prediction  is  at t =  1,  the first  example is  presented  at t = 0  and we 'set y(O)  =  O.  We  analyse here  a modification of the standard Williams&Zipser construction  that  is  appropriate for forecasting purposes.  The studied architecture is  layered.  Firstly,  we  remove  the external  inputs from  the linear  output unit in  order  to prevent  the  network from getting  trapped  in a linear mode.  The output then reads 
x(t + 1) = Yo(t + 1) = L WojYj(t)  + Wthres,o"

We propose two  models that employ different classification mechanisms; the first model  selects an auto-associative network whose recovered view best matches  the input view, and the second model is based on a modular architecture  whose  additional  network classifies  the  views  by  splitting  the  input  space  nonlinearly.

I. Williams, Michael Revow, Geoffrey E. Hinton","Deformable models are  an attractive approach to recognizing  non(cid:173) rigid objects which have considerable within class variability.  How(cid:173) ever,  there  are  severe  search  problems  associated  with  fitting  the  models to data.  We show that by using neural networks to provide  better starting points, the search time can be significantly reduced.  The method is  demonstrated on a  character  recognition task. 
In previous work  we  have  developed  an approach to handwritten character recogni(cid:173) tion  based  on  the use  of deformable models  (Hinton,  Williams and  Revow,  1992a;  Revow,  Williams and Hinton,  1993).  We have obtained good performance with this  method, but a major problem is that the search  procedure for fitting each model to  an  image is  very  computationally intensive,  because  there  is  no efficient  algorithm  (like  dynamic programming) for  this  task.  In this paper  we  demonstrate that it is  possible  to  ""compile  down""  some of the  knowledge  gained  while  fitting  models  to  data to obtain better  starting points that significantly reduce  the search  time. 
1  DEFORMABLE MODELS FOR DIGIT RECOGNITION 
The basic idea in using deformable models for digit recognition is that each digit has  a  model, and  a  test  image is  classified  by finding  the model which  is  most likely to  have generated it.  The quality of the match between model and test image depends  on the  deformation of the model, the amount of ink that is  attributed to noise  and  the  distance of the  remaining ink from  the  deformed model.

More  formally,  the two  important terms in  assessing  the fit  are  the prior  probabil(cid:173) ity  distribution  for  the  instantiation  parameters of a  model  (which  penalizes  very  distorted models),  and the imaging model that characterizes  the probability distri(cid:173) bution over  possible images given  the instantiated  model l .  Let  I  be an  image,  M  be a  model  and  z  be  its instantiation parameters.  Then the evidence  for  model M  is  given  by 
P(IIM) = J P(zIM)P(IIM, z)dz 
(1) 
The first  term in the integrand is the prior on the instantiation parameters and the  second  is  the  imaging model  i.e.,  the  likelihood of the  data given  the  instantiated  model.  P(MII) is  directly  proportional to P(IIM), as  we  assume  a  uniform prior  on each  digit.  Equation 1 is  formally correct,  but if z has more than a few  dimensions the evalua(cid:173) tion of this integral is very  computationally intensive.  However,  it is often  possible  to make an  approximation based on  the  assumption  that the integrand is strongly  peaked around  a  (global)  maximum value  z*.  In this case,  the evidence  can  be  ap(cid:173) proximated by the highest  peak of the integrand times a  volume factor  ~(zII, M),  which  measures  the sharpness of the  peak2 . 
P(IIM) ~ P(zIM)P(Ilz, M)~(zII, M) 
(2)  By  Taylor expanding  around  z*  to second  order  it  can  be  shown  that the  volume  factor  depends  on  the  determinant of the  Hessian  of 10gP(z, 11M)  .  Taking logs  of equation  2,  defining  EdeJ  as  the  negative  log  of P(z*IM),  and  EJit  as  the  cor(cid:173) responding  term  for  the  imaging model,  then  the  aim of the  search  is  to  find  the  minimum of E tot  =  EdeJ  + EJit .  Of course  the  total energy  will  have  many local  minima;  for  the  character  recognition  task  we  aim  to find  the  global  minimum by  using  a  continuation method (see  section  1.2). 
1.1  SPLINES, AFFINE TRANSFORMS  AND  IMAGING  MODELS 
This section  presents  a  brief overview  of our  work  on  using  deformable models for  digit recognition.  For a fuller  treatment, see  Revow,  Williams and  Hinton (1993) . 
Each  digit is  modelled by  a  cubic  B-spline  whose  shape  is  determined  by  the  posi(cid:173) tions of the control points in the object-based frame.  The models have eight control  points,  except  for  the  one  model which  has  three,  and  the  seven  model which  has  five.  To  generate  an  ideal  example of a  digit  the  control  points  are  positioned  at  their  ""home""  locations.  Deformed  characters  are  produced  by  perturbing  the  con(cid:173) trol  points  away  from  their  home  locations.  The  home  locations  and  covariance  matrix for  each  model were  adapted in order to improve the  performance. 
The deformation energy only penalizes shape  deformations.  Affine  transformations,  i.e., translation, rotation,  dilation, elongation, and shear,  do  not change the under(cid:173) lying shape of an  object so  we  want the  deformation energy  to be  invariant under  them .  We  achieve  this  by  giving  each  model  its  own  ""object-based  frame""  and  computing the deformation energy  relative to this frame.

Input sentences are generated from a simple phrase  structure grammar including number agreement,  verb  transitiv(cid:173) ity,  and recursive  noun phrase construction rules.  The  network  induces a grammar explicitly in the form of symbol categorization  rules and phrase structure rules. 
1  Purpose and related works 
The purpose of this research is to show that a self-organizing network with a certain  structure can acquire syntactic knowledge from only positive (i.e.  grammatical)  data,  without requiring  any initial  knowledge  or  external  teachers  that correct  errors.  There has been research on supervised neural network models of language acquisi(cid:173) tion tasks [Elman, 1991, Miikkulainen and Dyer, 1988, John and McClelland, 1988].  Unlike these supervised models, the current model self-organizes word and phrasal  categories and phrase construction rules through mere exposure to input sentences,  without any artificially defined  task goals.  There  also have been self-organizing  models of language  acquisition  tasks [Ritter and Kohonen, 1990,  Scholtes, 1991].  Compared to these models, the current model acquires phrase structure rules in  more explicit forms, and it learns wider and more structured contexts, as will be  explained below. 
2  Network Structure and Algorithm 
The design of the current network is motivated by the observation that humans  have  the  ability  to  handle  a  frequently  occurring  sequence of symbols (chunk)  as an unit of information [Grossberg, 1978, Mannes, 1993].  The network consists  of two parts:  classification networks and production networks (Figure 1).  The  classification networks categorize words and phrases, and the production networks

Pearson, Jim Bergen","The  efficiency  of image  search  can  be  greatly  improved  by  using  a  coarse-to-fine search strategy with a  multi-resolution image representa(cid:173) tion. However,  if the resolution is so low that the objects have few  dis(cid:173) tinguishing  features,  search  becomes  difficult.  We  show  that  the  performance of search at such low resolutions can be improved by using  context information, i.e., objects visible at low-resolution which are not  the objects of interest but are associated with them. The networks can be  given explicit context information as inputs, or they can learn to detect  the context objects, in which case the user does not have to be aware of  their existence. We also use Integrated Feature Pyramids, which repre(cid:173) sent high-frequency  information  at low  resolutions.  The use of multi(cid:173) resolution search techniques allows us to combine information about the  appearance of the objects on many scales in an efficient way.  A natural  fOlm  of exemplar selection also arises from these  techniques.  We illus(cid:173) trate these ideas by training hierarchical systems of neural  networks to  find clusters of buildings in aerial photographs of farmland."
