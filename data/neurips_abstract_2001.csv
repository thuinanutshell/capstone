We  can  use  this  to  bound  the  means  and  the  correlations.  For  networks  with  small  weights,  the  values  of  these statistics can be restricted to non-trivial regions  (i.e.  a subset  of  [-1 , 1]).  Experimental  results  show  that  reasonable  bounding  occurs  for  weight sizes  where  mean field  expansions  generally  give  good  results."

At the same time, human memory is not perfect. A cue can contain enough information to specify an item in memory, but fail to trigger that item. In the context of word memory, we present experiments that demonstrate some basic patterns in human memory errors. We use cues that consist of word frag- ments. We show that short and long cues are completed more accurately than medium length ones and study some of the factors that lead to this behavior. We then present a novel computational model that shows some of the ﬂexibility and patterns of errors that occur in human memory. This model iterates between bottom-up and top-down computations. These are tied together using a Markov model of words that allows memory to be accessed with a simple feature set, and enables a bottom-up process to compute a probability distribution of possible completions of word frag- ments, in a manner similar to models of visual perceptual completion."

It is known that the orientation selective responses of V1 neurons are reﬁned by visual experience. After eye opening, the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity in the early stages of the visual pathway depends both on the visual environment and on how the environment is scanned. We have used computational modeling to investigate how eye movements might affect the reﬁnement of the orientation tuning of simple cells in the pres- ence of a Hebbian scheme of synaptic plasticity. Levels of correlation be- tween the activity of simulated cells were examined while natural scenes were scanned so as to model sequences of saccades and ﬁxational eye movements, such as microsaccades, tremor and ocular drift. The speciﬁc patterns of activity required for a quantitatively accurate development of simple cell receptive ﬁelds with segregated ON and OFF subregions were observed during ﬁxational eye movements, but not in the presence of saccades or with static presentation of natural visual input. These re- sults suggest an important role for the eye movements occurring during visual ﬁxation in the reﬁnement of orientation selectivity."

Douglas","We describe a programmable multi-chip VLSI neuronal system that can be used for exploring spike-based information processing models. The system consists of a silicon retina, a PIC microcontroller, and a transceiver chip whose integrate-and-ﬁre neurons are connected in a soft winner-take-all architecture. The circuit on this multi-neuron chip ap- proximates a cortical microcircuit. The neurons can be conﬁgured for different computational properties by the virtual connections of a se- lected set of pixels on the silicon retina. The virtual wiring between the different chips is effected by an event-driven communication pro- tocol that uses asynchronous digital pulses, similar to spikes in a neu- ronal system. We used the multi-chip spike-based system to synthe- size orientation-tuned neurons using both a feedforward model and a feedback model. The performance of our analog hardware spiking model matched the experimental observations and digital simulations of continuous-valued neurons. The multi-chip VLSI system has advantages over computer neuronal models in that it is real-time, and the computa- tional time does not scale with the size of the neuronal network."

Our results are proven without re- quiring complicated concentration-of-measure arguments and they hold for arbitrary on-line learning algorithms. Furthermore, when applied to concrete on-line algorithms, our results yield tail bounds that in many cases are comparable or better than the best known bounds."

Faul, Michael E. Tipping","The recent introduction of the 'relevance vector machine' has effec(cid:173) tively  demonstrated  how  sparsity  may  be obtained  in  generalised  linear  models  within  a  Bayesian  framework.  Using  a  particular  form  of Gaussian  parameter prior,  'learning'  is  the  maximisation,  with respect  to hyperparameters, of the  marginal  likelihood  of the  data.  This  paper  studies  the  properties  of  that  objective  func(cid:173) tion,  and  demonstrates  that  conditioned  on  an  individual  hyper(cid:173) parameter,  the  marginal  likelihood  has  a  unique  maximum which  is  computable in closed form.  It is  further  shown that if a  derived  'sparsity criterion'  is  satisfied,  this maximum is  exactly  equivalent  to  'pruning' the corresponding parameter from  the model."

Sabatini, Fabio Solari, Giulia Andreani, Chiara Bartolozzi, Giacomo M. Bisio","A cortical model for  motion-in-depth selectivity of complex cells in  the  visual  cortex  is  proposed.  The  model  is  based  on  a  time  ex(cid:173) tension of the phase-based techniques for  disparity estimation.  We  consider  the  computation  of the  total  temporal  derivative  of the  time-varying disparity through the combination of the responses of  disparity energy units.  To take into account the physiological plau(cid:173) sibility, the model  is  based on the  combinations of binocular cells  characterized by different  ocular dominance indices.  The resulting  cortical units  of the model show  a  sharp selectivity for  motion-in(cid:173) depth that has been compared with that reported in the literature  for  real cortical cells."

Competition between actions  is based on the motivating characteristics of their consequent  states in this sense. Substantial, careful, experiments reviewed  in Dickinson & Balleine, 12,13 into the neurobiology and psychol(cid:173) ogy of motivation shows that this view is incomplete. In many  cases, animals are faced with the choice not between many dif(cid:173) ferent actions  at a given state, but rather whether a single re(cid:173) sponse is  worth  executing  at  all.  Evidence  suggests  that  the  motivational process underlying  this choice has different psy(cid:173) chological  and neural properties from  that underlying  action  choice.  We  describe  and  model  these  motivational  systems,  and consider the way they interact."

It is based on growing image parts by minimizing theoretical bounds on the error probability of an SVM. Component-based face classiﬁers are then combined in a second stage to yield a hierarchical SVM classiﬁer. Experimental results in face classiﬁcation show considerable robustness against rotations in depth and suggest performance at signiﬁcantly better level than other face detection systems. Novel aspects of our approach are: a) an algorithm to learn component-based classiﬁcation experts and their combination, b) the use of 3-D morphable models for training, and c) a maximum operation on the output of each component classiﬁer which may be relevant for bio- logical models of visual recognition."

J. Anderson, E. D. Young, Israel Nelken, Naftali Tishby","The  way  groups  of auditory  neurons  interact  to  code  acoustic  in(cid:173) formation is  investigated using an information theoretic approach.  We develop measures of redundancy among groups of neurons, and  apply  them  to  the  study  of collaborative  coding  efficiency  in  two  processing stations in the auditory pathway:  the inferior colliculus  (IC)  and the primary auditory cortex (AI).  Under two schemes for  the  coding  of the  acoustic  content,  acoustic  segments  coding  and  stimulus  identity  coding,  we  show  differences  both in  information  content and group redundancies between IC and AI neurons.  These  results  provide for  the first  time  a  direct  evidence for  redundancy  reduction  along  the  ascending  auditory  pathway,  as  has  been  hy(cid:173) pothesized for  theoretical considerations  [Barlow  1959,2001].  The  redundancy effects under the single-spikes coding scheme are signif(cid:173) icant only for  groups larger than ten cells, and cannot be revealed  with  the  redundancy  measures  that  use  only  pairs  of cells.  The  results  suggest  that the  auditory system transforms low  level  rep(cid:173) resentations that contain redundancies due to the statistical struc(cid:173) ture of natural stimuli, into a  representation in which cortical neu(cid:173) rons extract rare and independent component of complex acoustic  signals,  that are useful  for  auditory scene analysis."

Black, Elie Bienenstock, Shy Shoham, John P. Donoghue","Statistical learning and probabilistic inference techniques are used to in- fer the hand position of a subject from multi-electrode recordings of neu- ral activity in motor cortex. First, an array of electrodes provides train- ing data of neural ﬁring conditioned on hand kinematics. We learn a non- parametric representation of this ﬁring activity using a Bayesian model and rigorously compare it with previous models using cross-validation. Second, we infer a posterior probability distribution over hand motion conditioned on a sequence of neural test data using Bayesian inference. The learned ﬁring models of multiple cells are used to deﬁne a non- Gaussian likelihood term which is combined with a prior probability for the kinematics. A particle ﬁltering method is used to represent, update, and propagate the posterior distribution over time. The approach is com- pared with traditional linear ﬁltering methods; the results suggest that it may be appropriate for neural prosthetic applications."

Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann","We  consider  noisy  Euclidean  traveling  salesman  problems  in  the  plane,  which  are  random combinatorial problems  with  underlying  structure. Gibbs sampling is  used to compute average trajectories,  which  estimate  the  underlying structure common  to all  instances.  This procedure requires identifying the exact relationship between  permutations and tours.  In  a  learning setting,  the  average trajec(cid:173) tory  is  used  as  a  model  to  construct  solutions  to  new  instances  sampled from the same source. Experimental results show that the  average trajectory can in fact estimate the underlying structure and  that overfitting effects occur if the trajectory adapts too closely to  a  single instance."

We  propose  a  technique which  extends earlier work and aims at incorporating invariances in  non(cid:173) linear  kernels.  We  show  on  a  digit  recognition  task that the  pro(cid:173) posed  approach is  superior to the Virtual Support Vector method,  which  previously had been the method of choice."

In all three cases, we give sharp bounds on the accuracy of the obtained ap- proximations. Rather intriguingly, all three techniques can be viewed as instantiations of the following idea: replace the kernel function  by a “randomized kernel” which behaves like"

Shapiro, J. Wearden","Animal  data on delayed-reward conditioning experiments  shows  a  striking property - the  data for  different  time intervals  collapses  into  a  single  curve  when  the  data is  scaled  by  the  time  interval.  This is  called the scalar property of interval timing.  Here a  simple  model of a  neural  clock is  presented and shown to give  rise  to the  scalar  property.  The model  is  an accumulator consisting of noisy,  linear  spiking  neurons.  It  is  analytically  tractable  and  contains  only three parameters.  When coupled with reinforcement learning  it simulates peak procedure experiments, producing both the scalar  property and the pattern of single  trial covariances."

We propose a “hyper- bolic SOM” (HSOM) based on a regular tesselation of the hyperbolic plane, which is a non-euclidean space characterized by constant negative gaussian curvature. The exponentially increasing size of a neighborhood around a point in hyperbolic space provides more freedom to map the complex information space arising from language into spatial relations. We describe experiments, showing that the HSOM can successfully be applied to text categorization tasks and yields results comparable to other state-of-the-art methods."

In this pa- per, we provide a general probabilistic framework for clustering data into a set of classes organized as a taxonomy, where each class is associated with a prob- abilistic model from which the data was generated. The clustering algorithm simultaneously optimizes three things: the assignment of data instances to clus- ters, the models associated with the clusters, and the structure of the abstraction hierarchy. A unique feature of our approach is that it utilizes global optimization algorithms for both of the last two steps, reducing the sensitivity to noise and the propensity to local maxima that are characteristic of algorithms such as hierarchi- cal agglomerative clustering that only take local steps. We provide a theoretical analysis for our algorithm, showing that it converges to a local maximum of the joint likelihood of model and data. We present experimental results on synthetic data, and on real data in the domains of gene expression and text."

In such domains a cascade of simple classiﬁers each trained to achieve high detection rates and modest false positive rates can yield a ﬁnal detector with many desir- able features: including high detection rates, very low false positive rates, and fast performance. Achieving extremely high detection rates, rather than low error, is not a task typically addressed by machine learning al- gorithms. We propose a new variant of AdaBoost as a mechanism for training the simple classiﬁers used in the cascade. Experimental results in the domain of face detection show the training algorithm yields sig- niﬁcant improvements in performance over conventional AdaBoost. The ﬁnal face detection system can process 15 frames per second, achieves over 90% detection, and a false positive rate of 1 in a 1,000,000."

Given  a joint distribution  peA, B),  this  method  con(cid:173) structs a new variable T  that extracts partitions, or clusters, over the values of A  that are informative about B.  In  a recent paper,  we introduced a general princi(cid:173) pled framework for multivariate extensions of the information bottleneck method  that allows us to consider multiple systems of data partitions that are inter-related.  In this  paper,  we  present  a  new  family  of simple  agglomerative  algorithms  to  construct such systems of inter-related clusters.

We then propose modiﬁed K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms to overcome the per- ceived problem. The approach is similar in spirit to Tangent Distance, but with invariances inferred from the local neighborhood rather than prior knowledge. Experimental results on real world classiﬁcation tasks sug- gest that the modiﬁed KNN algorithms often give a dramatic improve- ment over standard KNN and perform as well or better than SVMs."

Griffiths, Joshua B. Tenenbaum","Estimating the parameters of sparse multinomial distributions is an important component of many statistical learning tasks. Recent approaches have used uncertainty over the vocabulary of symbols in a multinomial distribution as a means of accounting for sparsity. We present a Bayesian approach that allows weak prior knowledge, in the form of a small set of approximate candidate vocabularies, to be used to dramatically improve the resulting estimates. We demonstrate these improvements in applications to text compres(cid:173) sion and estimating distributions over words in newsgroup data."

Roberts","This paper proposes an approach to classiﬁcation of adjacent segments of a time series as being either of  classes. We use a hierarchical model that consists of a feature extraction stage and a generative classiﬁer which is built on top of these features. Such two stage approaches are often used in signal and image processing. The novel part of our work is that we link these stages probabilistically by using a latent feature space. To use one joint model is a Bayesian requirement, which has the advantage to fuse information according to its certainty. The classiﬁer is implemented as hidden Markov model with Gaussian and Multinomial observation distributions deﬁned on a suitably chosen representation of autoregressive models. The Markov dependency is mo- tivated by the assumption that successive classiﬁcations will be corre- lated. Inference is done with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tech- niques. We apply the proposed approach to synthetic data and to classi- ﬁcation of EEG that was recorded while the subjects performed different cognitive tasks. All experiments show that using a latent feature space results in a signiﬁcant improvement in generalization accuracy. Hence we expect that this idea generalizes well to other hierarchical models."

Hiles, Hwajin Yang, Nathan Intrator","To ﬁnd out how the representations of structured visual objects depend on the co-occurrence statistics of their constituents, we exposed subjects to a set of composite images with tight control exerted over (1) the condi- tional probabilities of the constituent fragments, and (2) the value of Bar- low’s criterion of “suspicious coincidence” (the ratio of joint probability to the product of marginals). We then compared the part veriﬁcation re- sponse times for various probe/target combinations before and after the exposure. For composite probes, the speedup was much larger for tar- gets that contained pairs of fragments perfectly predictive of each other, compared to those that did not. This effect was modulated by the sig- niﬁcance of their co-occurrence as estimated by Barlow’s criterion. For lone-fragment probes, the speedup in all conditions was generally lower than for composites. These results shed light on the brain’s strategies for unsupervised acquisition of structural information in vision."

Littman, Richard S. Sutton","We show that states of a dynamical system can be usefully repre(cid:173) sented by multi-step, action-conditional predictions of future ob(cid:173) servations. State representations that are grounded in data in this way may be easier to learn, generalize better, and be less depen(cid:173) dent on accurate prior models than, for example, POMDP state representations. Building on prior work by Jaeger and by Rivest and Schapire, in this paper we compare and contrast a linear spe(cid:173) cialization of the predictive approach with the state representa(cid:173) tions used in POMDPs and in k-order Markov models. Ours is the first specific formulation of the predictive idea that includes both stochasticity and actions (controls). We show that any system has a linear predictive state representation with number of predictions no greater than the number of states in its minimal POMDP model.
In predicting or controlling a sequence of observations, the concepts of state and state estimation inevitably arise. There have been two dominant approaches. The generative-model approach, typified by research on partially observable Markov de(cid:173) cision processes (POMDPs), hypothesizes a structure for generating observations and estimates its state and state dynamics. The history-based approach, typified by k-order Markov methods, uses simple functions of past observations as state, that is, as the immediate basis for prediction and control. (The data flow in these two ap(cid:173) proaches are diagrammed in Figure 1.) Of the two, the generative-model approach is more general. The model's internal state gives it temporally unlimited memory(cid:173) the ability to remember an event that happened arbitrarily long ago--whereas a history-based approach can only remember as far back as its history extends. The bane of generative-model approaches is that they are often strongly dependent on a good model of the system's dynamics. Most uses of POMDPs, for example, assume a perfect dynamics model and attempt only to estimate state.

In the traditional classifi- cation setting, the resulting classifier is rarely analyzed in terms of the properties of the input data captured by the discriminative model. How- ever, such analysis is crucial if we want to understand and visualize the detected differences. We propose an approach to interpretation of the sta- tistical model in the original feature space that allows us to argue about the model in terms of the relevant changes to the input vectors. For each point in the input space, we define a discriminative direction to be the direction that moves the point towards the other class while introducing as little irrelevant change as possible with respect to the classifier func- tion. We derive the discriminative direction for kernel-based classifiers, demonstrate the technique on several examples and briefly discuss its use in the statistical shape analysis, an application that originally motivated this work. 1 Introduction
Once a classifier is estimated from the training data, it can be used to label new examples, and in many application domains, such as character recognition, text classification and oth- ers, this constitutes the final goal of the learning stage. The statistical learning algorithms are also used in scientific studies to detect and analyze differences between the two classes when the ``correct answer'' is unknown, and the information we have on the differences is represented implicitly by the training set. Example applications include morphologi- cal analysis of anatomical organs (comparing organ shape in patients vs. normal controls), molecular design (identifying complex molecules that satisfy certain requirements), etc. In such applications, interpretation of the resulting classifier in terms of the original feature vectors can provide an insight into the nature of the differences detected by the learning algorithm and is therefore a crucial step in the analysis. Furthermore, we would argue that studying the spatial structure of the data captured by the classification function is important in any application, as it leads to a better understanding of the data and can potentially help in improving the technique. This paper addresses the problem of translating a classifier into a different representation
that allows us to visualize and study the differences between the classes. We introduce and derive a so called discriminative direction at every point in the original feature space with respect to a given classifier. Informally speaking, the discriminative direction tells us how to change any input example to make it look more like an example from another class without introducing any irrelevant changes that possibly make it more similar to other examples from the same class. It allows us to characterize differences captured by the classifier and to express them as changes in the original input examples. This paper is organized as follows. We start with a brief background section on kernel- based classification, stating without proof the main facts on kernel-based SVMs necessary for derivation of the discriminative direction. We follow the notation used in [3, 8, 9]. In Section 3, we provide a formal definition of the discriminative direction and explain how it can be estimated from the classification function. We then present some special cases, in which the computation can be simplified significantly due to a particular structure of the kernel. Section 4 demonstrates the discriminative direction for different kernels, followed by an example from the problem of statistical analysis of shape differences that originally motivated this work."

Attempts to study the neu- ral coding of these natural signals face challenges both in the selection of the signal ensemble and in the analysis of the resulting neural responses. For zebra ﬁnches, naturalistic stimuli can be deﬁned as sounds that they encounter in a colony of conspeciﬁc birds. We assembled an ensemble of these sounds by recording groups of 10-40 zebra ﬁnches, and then ana- lyzed the response of single neurons in the songbird central auditory area (ﬁeld L) to continuous playback of long segments from this ensemble. Following methods developed in the ﬂy visual system, we measured the information that spike trains provide about the acoustic stimulus with- out any assumptions about which features of the stimulus are relevant. Preliminary results indicate that large amounts of information are carried by spike timing, with roughly half of the information accessible only at time resolutions better than 10 ms; additional information is still be- ing revealed as time resolution is improved to 2 ms. Information can be decomposed into that carried by the locking of individual spikes to the stimulus (or modulations of spike rate) vs. that carried by timing in spike patterns. Initial results show that in ﬁeld L, temporal patterns give at least

We also consider an analogous use of kernel functions to run the multiplicative-update Winnow algorithm over an expanded feature space of exponentially many conjunctions. While known upper bounds imply that Winnow can learn DNF formulae with a polynomial mistake bound in this setting, we prove that it is computationally hard to simulate Win- now’s behavior for learning DNF over such a feature set, and thus that such kernel functions for Winnow are not efﬁciently computable."

Colagrosso, Cesar Guerra-Salcedo, Richard Wolniewicz","When designing a two-alternative classiﬁer, one ordinarily aims to maximize the classiﬁer’s ability to discriminate between members of the two classes. We describe a situation in a real-world business application of machine-learning prediction in which an additional constraint is placed on the nature of the solu- tion: that the classiﬁer achieve a speciﬁed correct acceptance or correct rejection rate (i.e., that it achieve a ﬁxed accuracy on members of one class or the other). Our domain is predicting churn in the telecommunications industry. Churn refers to customers who switch from one service provider to another. We pro- pose four algorithms for training a classiﬁer subject to this domain constraint, and present results showing that each algorithm yields a reliable improvement in performance. Although the improvement is modest in magnitude, it is nonethe- less impressive given the difﬁculty of the problem and the ﬁnancial return that it achieves to the service provider.
When designing a classiﬁer, one must specify an objective measure by which the classi- ﬁer’s performance is to be evaluated. One simple objective measure is to minimize the number of misclassiﬁcations. If the cost of a classiﬁcation error depends on the target and/ or response class, one might utilize a risk-minimization framework to reduce the expected loss. A more general approach is to maximize the classiﬁer’s ability to discriminate one class from another class (e.g., Chang & Lippmann, 1994).
An ROC curve (Green & Swets, 1966) can be used to visualize the discriminative performance of a two-alternative classiﬁer that outputs class posteriors. To explain the ROC curve, a classiﬁer can be thought of as making a positive/negative judgement as to whether an input is a member of some class. Two different accuracy measures can be obtained from the classiﬁer: the accuracy of correctly identifying an input as a member of the class (a correct acceptance or CA), and the accuracy of correctly identifying an input as a nonmember of the class (a correct rejection or CR). To evaluate the CA and CR rates, it is necessary to pick a threshold above which the classiﬁer’s probability estimate is inter- preted as an “accept,” and below which is interpreted as a “reject”—call this the criterion. The ROC curve plots CA against CR rates for various criteria (Figure 1a). Note that as the threshold is lowered, the CA rate increases and the CR rate decreases. For a criterion of 1, the CA rate approaches 0 and the CR rate 1; for a criterion of 0, the CA rate approaches 1"

Manning","This paper presents a novel approach to the unsupervised learning of syn- tactic analyses of natural language text. Most previous work has focused on maximizing likelihood according to generative PCFG models. In con- trast, we employ a simpler probabilistic model over trees based directly on constituent identity and linear context, and use an EM-like iterative procedure to induce structure. This method produces much higher qual- ity analyses, giving the best published results on the ATIS dataset. 1 Overview
To enable a wide range of subsequent tasks, human language sentences are standardly given tree-structure analyses, wherein the nodes in a tree dominate contiguous spans of words called constituents, as in figure 1(a). Constituents are the linguistically coherent units in the sentence, and are usually labeled with a constituent category, such as noun phrase (NP) or verb phrase (VP). An aim of grammar induction systems is to figure out, given just the sentences in a corpus S, what tree structures correspond to them. In this sense, the grammar induction problem is an incomplete data problem, where the complete data is the corpus of trees T , but we only observe their yields S. This paper presents a new approach to this problem, which gains leverage by directly making use of constituent contexts. It is an open problem whether entirely unsupervised methods can produce linguistically accurate parses of sentences. Due to the difficulty of this task, the vast majority of statis- tical parsing work has focused on supervised learning approaches to parsing, where one uses a treebank of fully parsed sentences to induce a model which parses unseen sentences [7, 3]. But there are compelling motivations for unsupervised grammar induction. Building supervised training data requires considerable resources, including time and linguistic ex- pertise. Investigating unsupervised methods can shed light on linguistic phenomena which are implicit within a supervised parser's supervisory information (e.g., unsupervised sys- tems often have difficulty correctly attaching subjects to verbs above objects, whereas for a supervised parser, this ordering is implicit in the supervisory information). Finally, while the presented system makes no claims to modeling human language acquisition, results on whether there is enough information in sentences to recover their structure are important data for linguistic theory, where it has standardly been assumed that the information in the data is deficient, and strong innate knowledge is required for language acquisition [4]."

Furthermore, the IVM provides an estimate of the underlying probability. Similar to the “support points” of the SVM, the IVM model uses only a fraction of the training data to index kernel basis functions, typically a much smaller fraction than the SVM.

Donchin, Reza Shadmehr","Reaching movements require the brain to generate motor com- mands that rely on an internal model of the task's dynamics. Here we consider the errors that subjects make early in their reaching trajectories to various targets as they learn an internal model. Us- ing a framework from function approximation, we argue that the sequence of errors should reflect the process of gradient descent. If so, then the sequence of errors should obey hidden state transitions of a simple dynamical system. Fitting the system to human data, we find a surprisingly good fit accounting for 98% of the variance. This allows us to draw tentative conclusions about the basis ele- ments used by the brain in transforming sensory space to motor commands. To test the robustness of the results, we estimate the shape of the basis elements under two conditions: in a traditional learning paradigm with a consistent force field, and in a random sequence of force fields where learning is not possible. Remarkably, we find that the basis remains invariant. 1 Introduction
It appears that in constructing the motor commands to guide the arm toward a target, the brain relies on an internal model (IM) of the dynamics of the task that it learns through practice [1]. The IM is presumably a system that transforms a desired limb trajectory in sensory coordinates to motor commands. The motor commands in turn create the complex activation of muscles necessary to cause action. A major issue in motor control is to infer characteristics of the IM from the actions of subjects. Recently, we took a first step toward mathematically characterizing the IM's rep- resentation in the brain [2]. We analyzed the sequence of errors made by subjects on successive movements as they reached to targets while holding a robotic arm. The robot produced a force field and subjects learned to compensate for the field (presumably by constructing an IM) and eventually produced straight movements within the field. Our analysis sought to draw conclusions about the structure of the IM from the sequence of errors generated by the subjects. For instance, in a
velocity-dependent force field (such as the fields we use), the IM must be able to encode velocity in order to anticipate the upcoming force. We hoped that the e#ect of errors in one direction on subsequent movements in other directions would give information about the width of the elements which the IM used in encoding velocity. For example, if the basis elements were narrow, then movements in a given direction would result in little or no change in performance in neighboring directions. Wide basis elements would mean appropriately larger e#ects. We hypothesized that an estimate of the width of the basis elements could be cal- culated by fitting the time sequence of errors to a set of equations representing a dynamical system.

Trappenberg, Edmund T. Rolls, Simon M. Stringer","Inferior temporal cortex (IT) neurons have large receptive ﬁelds when a single effective object stimulus is shown against a blank background, but have much smaller receptive ﬁelds when the object is placed in a natural scene. Thus, translation invariant object recognition is reduced in natural scenes, and this may help object selection. We describe a model which accounts for this by competition within an attractor in which the neurons are tuned to different objects in the scene, and the fovea has a higher cortical magniﬁcation factor than the peripheral visual ﬁeld. Further- more, we show that top-down object bias can increase the receptive ﬁeld size, facilitating object search in complex visual scenes, and providing a model of object-based attention. The model leads to the prediction that introduction of a second object into a scene with blank background will reduce the receptive ﬁeld size to values that depend on the closeness of the second object to the target stimulus. We suggest that mechanisms of this type enable the output of IT to be primarily about one object, so that the areas that receive from IT can select the object as a potential target for action."

The novelty of our approach is the study of an operator in Hilbert space, represented by the Schr¨odinger equation of which the probability function is a solution. This Schr¨odinger equation contains a potential function that can be derived analytically from the probability function. We associate minima of the potential with cluster centers. The method has one variable parameter, the scale of its Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate its applicability on known data sets. By limiting the evaluation of the Schr¨odinger potential to the locations of data points, we can apply this method to problems in high dimensions."

We show that such networks have stimulus-locked traveling pulse solutions that are appropriate for modeling the responses of direction selective cortical neurons. In addition, our analysis shows that outside a certain regime of stimulus speeds the stability of this solutions breaks down giving rise to another class of solutions that are characterized by speciﬁc spatio- temporal periodicity.

Colagrosso, David E. Huber","We are interested in the mechanisms by which individuals monitor and adjust their performance of simple cognitive tasks. We model a speeded discrimination task in which individuals are asked to classify a sequence of stimuli (Jones & Braver, 2001). Response conﬂict arises when one stimulus class is infrequent relative to another, resulting in more errors and slower reaction times for the infrequent class. How do control pro- cesses modulate behavior based on the relative class frequencies? We explain performance from a rational perspective that casts the goal of individuals as minimizing a cost that depends both on error rate and re- action time. With two additional assumptions of rationality—that class prior probabilities are accurately estimated and that inference is optimal subject to limitations on rate of information transmission—we obtain a good ﬁt to overall RT and error data, as well as trial-by-trial variations in performance.
Consider the following scenario: While driving, you approach an intersection at which the trafﬁc light has already turned yellow, signaling that it is about to turn red. You also notice that a car is approaching you rapidly from behind, with no indication of slowing. Should you stop or speed through the intersection? The decision is difﬁcult due to the presence of two conﬂicting signals. Such response conﬂict can be produced in a psychological labo- ratory as well. For example, Stroop (1935) asked individuals to name the color of ink on which a word is printed. When the words are color names incongruous with the ink color— e.g., “blue” printed in red—reaction times are slower and error rates are higher. We are in- terested in the control mechanisms underlying performance of high-conﬂict tasks. Conﬂict requires individuals to monitor and adjust their behavior, possibly responding more slowly if errors are too frequent.
In this paper, we model a speeded discrimination paradigm in which individuals are asked to classify a sequence of stimuli (Jones & Braver, 2001). The stimuli are letters of the alphabet, A–Z, presented in rapid succession. In a choice task, individuals are asked to press one response key if the letter is an X or another response key for any letter other than X (as a shorthand, we will refer to non-X stimuli as Y). In a go/no-go task, individuals
 
are asked to press a response key when X is presented and to make no response otherwise. We address both tasks because they elicit slightly different decision-making behavior. In both tasks, Jones and Braver (2001) manipulated the relative frequency of the X and Y stimuli; the ratio of presentation frequency was either 17:83, 50:50, or 83:17. Response conﬂict arises when the two stimulus classes are unbalanced in frequency, resulting in more errors and slower reaction times. For example, when X’s are frequent but Y is presented, individuals are predisposed toward producing the X response, and this predisposition must be overcome by the perceptual evidence from the Y.
Jones and Braver (2001) also performed an fMRI study of this task and found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) becomes activated in situations involving response conﬂict. Specif- ically, when one stimulus occurs infrequently relative to the other, event-related fMRI re- sponse in the ACC is greater for the low frequency stimulus. Jones and Braver also ex- tended a neural network model of Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, and Cohen (2001) to account for human performance in the two discrimination tasks. The heart of the model is a mechanism that monitors conﬂict—the posited role of the ACC—and adjusts response biases accordingly. In this paper, we develop a parsimonious alternative account of the role of the ACC and of how control processes modulate behavior when response conﬂict arises.
1 A RATIONAL ANALYSIS
Our account is based on a rational analysis of human cognition, which views cognitive processes as being optimized with respect to certain task-related goals, and being adaptive to the structure of the environment (Anderson, 1990). We make three assumptions of ratio- nality: (1) perceptual inference is optimal but is subject to rate limitations on information transmission, (2) response class prior probabilities are accurately estimated, and (3) the goal of individuals is to minimize a cost that depends both on error rate and reaction time.
The heart of our account is an existing probabilistic model that explains a variety of fa- cilitation effects that arise from long-term repetition priming (Colagrosso, in preparation; Mozer, Colagrosso, & Huber, 2000), and more broadly, that addresses changes in the na- ture of information transmission in neocortex due to experience. We give a brief overview of this model; the details are not essential for the present work.
The model posits that neocortex can be characterized by a collection of information- processing pathways, and any act of cognition involves coordination among pathways. To model a simple discrimination task, we might suppose a perceptual pathway to map the visual input to a semantic representation, and a response pathway to map the semantic representation to a response. The choice and go/no-go tasks described earlier share a per- ceptual pathway, but require different response pathways. The model is framed in terms of probability theory: pathway inputs and outputs are random variables and microinference in a pathway is carried out by Bayesian belief revision."

The representation in these subspace methods is based on second order statistics of the image set, and does not address higher order statistical dependencies such as the relation(cid:173) ships among three or more pixels. Recently Higher Order Statistics and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been used as in(cid:173) formative low dimensional representations for visual recognition. In this paper, we investigate the use of Kernel Principal Compo(cid:173) nent Analysis and Kernel Fisher Linear Discriminant for learning low dimensional representations for face recognition, which we call Kernel Eigenface and Kernel Fisherface methods. While Eigenface and Fisherface methods aim to find projection directions based on the second order correlation of samples, Kernel Eigenface and Ker(cid:173) nel Fisherface methods provide generalizations which take higher order correlations into account. We compare the performance of kernel methods with Eigenface, Fisherface and ICA-based meth(cid:173) ods for face recognition with variation in pose, scale, lighting and expression. Experimental results show that kernel methods pro(cid:173) vide better representations and achieve lower error rates for face recognition.
1 Motivation and Approach
Subspace methods have been applied successfully in numerous visual recognition tasks such as face localization, face recognition, 3D object recognition, and tracking. In particular, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [20] [13] ,and Fisher Linear Dis(cid:173) criminant (FLD) methods [6] have been applied to face recognition with impressive results. While PCA aims to extract a subspace in which the variance is maximized (or the reconstruction error is minimized), some unwanted variations (due to light(cid:173) ing, facial expressions, viewing points, etc.) may be retained (See [8] for examples). It has been observed that in face recognition the variations between the images of the same face due to illumination and viewing direction are almost always larger than image variations due to the changes in face identity [1]. Therefore, while the PCA projections are optimal in a correlation sense (or for reconstruction"" from a low dimensional subspace), these eigenvectors or bases may be suboptimal from the
classification viewpoint.
Representations of Eigenface [20] (based on PCA) and Fisherface [6] (based on FLD) methods encode the pattern information based on the second order dependencies, i.e., pixelwise covariance among the pixels, and are insensitive to the dependencies among multiple (more than two) pixels in the samples. Higher order dependencies in an image include nonlinear relations among the pixel intensity values, such as the relationships among three or more pixels in an edge or a curve, which can cap(cid:173) ture important information for recognition. Several researchers have conjectured that higher order statistics may be crucial to better represent complex patterns. Recently, Higher Order Statistics (HOS) have been applied to visual learning prob(cid:173) lems. Rajagopalan et ale use HOS of the images of a target object to get a better approximation of an unknown distribution. Experiments on face detection [16] and vehicle detection [15] show comparable, if no better, results than other PCA-based methods.
The concept of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) maximizes the degree of statistical independence of output variables using contrast functions such as Kullback-Leibler divergence, negentropy, and cumulants [9] [10]. A neural net(cid:173) work algorithm to carry out ICA was proposed by Bell and Sejnowski [7], and was applied to face recognition [3]. Although the idea of computing higher order mo(cid:173) ments in the ICA-based face recognition method is attractive, the assumption that the face images comprise of a set of independent basis images (or factorial codes) is not intuitively clear. In [3] Bartlett et ale showed that ICA representation out(cid:173) perform PCA representation in face recognition using a subset of frontal FERET face images. However, Moghaddam recently showed that ICA representation does not provide significant advantage over PCA [12]. The experimental results suggest that seeking non-Gaussian and independent components may not necessarily yield better representation for face recognition.
In [18], Sch6lkopf et ale extended the conventional PCA to Kernel Principal Com(cid:173) ponent Analysis (KPCA). Empirical results on digit recognition using MNIST data set and object recognition using a database of rendered chair images showed that Kernel PCA is able to extract nonlinear features and thus provided better recog(cid:173) nition results. Recently Baudat and Anouar, Roth and Steinhage, and Mika et ale applied kernel tricks to FLD and proposed Kernel Fisher Linear Discriminant (KFLD) method [11] [17] [5]. Their experiments showed that KFLD is able to ex(cid:173) tract the most discriminant features in the feature space, which is equivalent to extracting the most discriminant nonlinear features in the original input space.
In this paper we seek a method that not only extracts higher order statistics of samples as features, but also maximizes the class separation when we project these features to a lower dimensional space for efficient recognition. Since much of the important information may be contained in the high order dependences among the pixels of a: face image, we investigate the use of Kernel PCA and Kernel FLD for face recognition, which we call Kernel Eigenface and Kernel Fisherface methods, and compare their performance against the standard Eigenface, Fisherface and ICA methods. In the meanwhile, we explain why kernel methods are suitable for visual recognition tasks such as face recognition.

This allocation scheme distributes funds across various securities or ﬁ- nancial markets while simultaneously complying with speciﬁc allocation constraints which meet the requirements of an investor. The portfolio optimization algorithm is modeled by a feedforward neural network. The underlying expected return forecasts are based on error correction neural networks (ECNN), which utilize the last model error as an auxiliary input to evaluate their own misspeciﬁcation. The portfolio optimization is implemented such that (i.) the allocations comply with investor’s constraints and that (ii.) the risk of the portfo- lio can be controlled. We demonstrate the proﬁtability of our approach by constructing internationally diversiﬁed portfolios across  different ﬁnancial markets of the G7 contries. It turns out, that our approach is superior to a preset benchmark portfolio.
1 Introduction: Portfolio-Management
We integrate the portfolio optimization algorithm suggested by Black / Litterman [1] into a neural network architecture. Combining the mean-variance theory [5] with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) [7], this approach utilizes excess returns of the CAPM equilibrium to deﬁne a neutral, well balanced benchmark portfolio. Deviations from the benchmark allocation are only allowed within preset boundaries. Hence, as an advantage, there are no unrealistic solutions (e. g. large short positions, huge portfolio changes). Moreover, there is no need of formulating return expectations for all assets.
In contrast to Black / Litterman, excess return forecasts are estimated by time-delay recur- rent error correction neural networks [8]. Investment decisions which comply with given allocation constraints are derived from these predictions.

O'Reilly, R. S. Busby","We present a model of binding of relationship information in a spatial domain (e.g., square above triangle) that uses low-order coarse-coded
conjunctive representations instead of more popular temporal synchrony mechanisms. Supporters of temporal synchrony argue that conjunctive representations lack both efficiency (i.e., combinatorial numbers of units are required) and systematicity (i.e., the resulting representations are overly specific and thus do not support generalization to novel exem- plars). To counter these claims, we show that our model: a) uses far fewer hidden units than the number of conjunctions represented, by us- ing coarse-coded, distributed representations where each unit has a broad tuning curve through high-dimensional conjunction space, and b) is ca- pable of considerable generalization to novel inputs. 1 Introduction
The binding problem as it is classically conceived arises when different pieces of infor- mation are processed by entirely separate units. For example, we can imagine there are neurons that separately code for the shape and color of objects, and we are viewing a scene having a red triangle and a blue square (Figure 1). Because color and shape are encoded separately in this system, the internal representations do not discriminate this situation from one where we are viewing a red square and a blue triangle. This is the problem. Broadly speaking, there are two solutions to it. Perhaps the most popular solution is to imagine that binding is encoded by some kind of transient signal, such as temporal synchrony (e.g., von der Malsburg, 1981; Gray, Engel, Konig, & Singer, 1992; Hummel & Holyoak, 1997). Under this solution, the red and triangle units should fire together, as should the blue and square units, with each group firing out of phase with the other. The other solution can be construed as solving the problem by questioning its fundamental assumption --- that information is encoded completely separately in the first place (which is so seductive that it typically goes unnoticed). Instead, one can imagine that color and shape information are encoded together (i.e., conjunctively). In the red-triangle blue-square example, some neurons encode the conjunction of red and triangle, while others encode the conjunction of blue and square. Because these units are explicitly sensitive to these

Table 1: Solution to the binding problem by using representations that encode combinations of input features (i.e., color and shape), but achieve greater efficiency by representing multiple such combinations. Obj1 and obj2 show the features of the two objects (R = Red, G = Green, B = Blue, S = Square, C = Circle, T = Triangle), and remaining columns show 6 localist units and one coarse- coded conjunctive unit. Adding this one conjunctive unit is enough to disambiguate the inputs. conjunctions, they will not fire to a red square or a blue triangle, and thereby avoid the binding problem. The obvious problem with this solution, and one reason it has been largely rejected in the literature, is that it would appear to require far too many units to cover all of the possible conjunctions that need to be represented --- a combinatorial explosion. However, the combinatorial explosion problem is predicated on another seductive notion --- that separate units are used for each possible conjunction. In short, both the binding prob- lem itself and the problem with the conjunctive solution derive from localist assumptions about neural coding. In contrast, these problems can be greatly reduced by simply thinking in terms of distributed representations, where each unit encodes some possibly-difficult to describe amalgam of input features, such that individual units are active at different levels for different inputs, and many such units are active for each input (Hinton, McClelland, & Rumelhart, 1986). Therefore, the input is represented by a complex distributed pattern of activation over units, and each unit can exhibit varying levels of sensitivity to the featural conjunctions present in the input. The binding problem is largely avoided because a differ- ent pattern of activation will be present for a red-triangle, blue-square input as compared to a red-square, blue-triangle input. These kinds of distributed representations can be difficult to understand. This is probably a significant reason why the ability of distributed representations to resolve the binding problem goes under-appreciated. However, we can analyze special cases of these repre- sentations to gain some insight. One such special case is shown in Table 1 from O'Reilly and Munakata (2000). Here, we add one additional distributed unit to an otherwise localist
featural encoding like that shown in Figure 1. This unit has a coarse-coded conjunctive representation, meaning that instead of coding for a single conjunction, it codes for several possible conjunctions. The table shows that if this set of conjunctions is chosen wisely, this single unit can enable the distributed pattern of activation across all units to distinguish between any two possible combinations of stimulus inputs. A more realistic system will have a larger number of partially redundant coarse-coded conjunctive units that will not require such precise representations from each unit. A similar demonstration was recently provided by Mel and Fiser (2000) in an analysis of distributed, low-order conjunctive rep- resentations (resembling ``Wickelfeatures''; Wickelgren, 1969; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989) in the domain of textual inputs. However, they did not demonstrate that a neural net- work learning mechanism would develop these representations, or that they could support systematic generalization to novel inputs. 2 Learning Generalizable Relational Bindings
We present here a series of models that test the ability of existing neural network learning mechanisms to develop low-order coarse-coded conjunctive representations in a challeng- ing binding domain. Specifically, we focus on the problem of relational binding, which provides a link to higher-level cognitive function, and speaks to the continued use of struc- tured representations in these domains. Furthermore, we conduct a critical test of these models in assessing their ability to generalize to novel inputs after moderate amounts of training. This is important because conjunctive representations might appear to limit gen- eralization as these representations are more specific than purely localist representations. Indeed the inability to generalize is considered by some the primary limitation of conjunc- tive binding mechanisms (Holyoak & Hummel, 2000).
2.1 Relational Binding, Structured Representations, and Higher-level Cognition
A number of existing models rely on structured representations because they are regarded as essential for encoding complex relational information and other kinds of data structures that are used in symbolic models (e.g., lists, trees, sequences) (e.g., Touretzky, 1986; Shas- tri & Ajjanagadde, 1993; Hummel & Holyoak, 1997). A canonical example of a structured representation is a propositional encoding (e.g., LIKES cats milk) that has a main relational term (LIKES) that operates on a set of slot-like arguments that specify the items enter- ing into the relationship. The primary advantages of such a representation are that it is transparently systematic or productive (anything can be put in the slots), and it is typically easy to compose more elaborate structures from these individual propositions (e.g., this proposition can have other propositions in its slots instead of just basic symbols). The fundamental problem with structured representations, regardless of what implements them, is that they cannot be easily learned. To date, there have been no structured rep- resentation models that exhibit powerful learning of the form typically associated with neural networks. There are good reasons to believe that this reflects basic tradeoffs between complex structured representations and powerful learning mechanisms (Elman, 1991; St John & McClelland, 1990; O'Reilly & Munakata, 2000). Essentially, structured representations are discrete and fragile, and therefore do not admit to gradual changes over learning. In contrast, neural networks employ massively-parallel, graded processing that can search out many possible solutions at the same time, and optimize those that seem to make graded improvements in performance. In contrast, the discrete character of structured representations requires exhaustive combinatorial search in high-dimensional spaces. To provide an alternative to these structured representations, our models test a simple ex- ample of relational encoding, focusing on easily-visualized spatial relationships, which can be thought of in propositional terms as for example (LEFT-OF square triangle).
Input Location Question Hidden where? what? relation-obj? relation-loc? Relation Object right left above below Figure 2: Spatial relationship binding model. Objects are represented by distributed patterns of activation over 8 features per location within a 4x4 array of locations. Inputs have two objects, arranged vertically or horizontally. The network answers questions posed by the Question input (what'',where'', and ``what relationship?'') --- the answers require binding of object, location, and relationship information. 3 Spatial Relationship Binding Model
The spatial relationship binding model is shown in Figure 2. The overall framework for training the network is to present it with input patterns containing objects in different loca- tions, and ask it various questions about these input displays. These questions ask about the identity and location of objects (i.e., what?'' andwhere?''), and the relationships between the two objects (e.g., where is object1 relative to object2?''). To answer these questions correctly, the hidden layer must bind object, location, and relationship information accu- rately in the hidden layer. Otherwise, it will confuse the two objects and their locations and relationships. Furthermore, we encoded the objects using distributed representations over features, so these features must be correctly bound into the same object. Specifically, objects are represented by distributed patterns of activation over 8 features per location, in a 4x4 location array. Inputs have two different objects, arranged either vertically or horizontally. The network answers different questions about the objects posed by the Question input. For thewhat?'' question, the location of one of the objects is activated as an input in the Location layer, and the network must produce the correct object features for the object in that location. We also refer to this target object as the agent object. For the where?'' question, the object features for the agent object are activated in the Object layer, and the network must produce the correct location activation for that object. For therelation-obj?'' question, the object features for the agent object are activated, and the network must activate the relationship between this object and the other object (referred to as the patient object), in addition to activating the location for the agent object. For the ``relation-loc?'' question, the location of the agent object is activated, and the network must activate the relationship between this object and the patient object, in addition to activating the object features for the agent object. This network architecture has a number of nice properties. For example, it has only one object and location encoding layer, both of which can act as either an input or an output. This is better than an alternative architecture having separate slots representing the agent and patient objects, because such slot-based encodings solve the binding problem by having separate role-specific units, which becomes implausible as the number of different roles and objects multiply. Note that supporting the dual input/output roles requires an interactive (recurrent, bidirectionally-connected) network (O'Reilly, 2001, 1998).

Figure 3: Hidden unit representations (values are weights into a hidden unit from all other layers) showing units (a & b) that bind object, location, & relationship information via low-order conjunc- tions, and other units that have systematic representations of location (c) and object features (d). There are four levels of questions we can ask about this network. First, we can ask if stan- dard neural network learning mechanisms are capable of solving this challenging binding problem. They are. Second, we can ask whether the network actually develops coarse- coded distributed representations. It does. Third, we can ask if these networks can gener- alize to novel inputs (both novel objects and novel locations for existing objects). They can. Finally, we can ask whether there are differences in how well different kinds of learning algorithms generalize, specifically comparing the Leabra algorithm with purely error-driven networks, as was recently done in other generalization tests with interactive networks (O'Reilly, 2001). This paper showed that interactive networks generalize signif- icantly worse than comparable feedforward networks, but that good generalization can be achieved by adding additional biases or constraints on the learning mechanisms in the form of inhibitory competition and Hebbian learning in the Leabra algorithm. These results are replicated here, with Leabra generalization being roughly twice as good as other interactive algorithms.

First, we examined the representations that developed in the network's hidden layer (Fig- ure 3). Many units encoded low-order combinations (conjunctions) of object, location, and relationship features (Figure 3a & b). This is consistent with our hypothesis. Other units also encoded more systematic representations of location without respect to objects (Figure 3c) and object features without respect to location (Figure 3d). To test the generalization capacity of the networks, we trained on only 26 of the 28 possible objects that can be composed out of 8 features with two units active, and only a subset of all 416 possible agent object x location combinations. We trained on 200, 300, and 400 such combinations. For each agent object-location input, there are 150 different patient object-location combinations per agent object-location, and we trained on 4, 10, 20, and 40, selected at random, for each different level of agent object-location combination training. At the most (400x40) there were a total of 16000 unique inputs trained out of a total possible of 62400, which amounts to about 1/4 of the training space. At the least (200x4) only roughly 1.3% of the training space was covered. The ability of the network to generalize to the 26 familiar objects in novel locations was tested by measuring performance on a random sample of 640 of the untrained agent object- location combinations. The results for the Leabra algorithm are shown in Figure 4a. As one would expect, the number of training patterns improves generalization in a roughly propor- tional manner. Importantly, the network is able to generalize to a high level of performance, getting roughly 95% correct after training on only 25% of the training space (400x40), and achieving roughly 80% correct after training on only roughly 10% of the space (300x20). The ability of the network to generalize to novel objects was tested by simply presenting the two novel objects as agents in all possible locations, with a random sampling of 20 different patients (which were the familiar objects), for a total of 640 different testing items (Figure 4b). Generalization on these novel objects was roughly comparable to the famil- iar objects, except there was an apparent ceiling point at roughly 15% generalization error where the generalization did not improve even with more training. Overall, the network performed remarkably well on these novel objects, and future work will explore general- ization with fewer training objects. To evaluate the extent to which the additional biologically-motivated biases in the Leabra algorithm are contributing to these generalization results, we ran networks using the con- trastive Hebbian learning algorithm (CHL) and the Almeida-Pineda (AP) recurrent back-

Both of these algorithms work in interactive, bidirectionally-connected networks, which are required for this task. Standard AP was unable to learn the task, we suspected because it does not preserve the symmetry of the weights as is required for stable settling. Attempts to to rectify this problem by enforc- ing symmetric weight changes did not succeed either. The results for CHL (Figure 5) replicated earlier results (O'Reilly, 2001) in showing that the additional biases in Leabra produced roughly twice as good of generalization performance compared to CHL. 4 Discussion
These networks demonstrate that existing, powerful neural network learning algorithms can learn representations that perform complex relational binding of information. Specifically, these networks had to bind together object identity, location, and relationship informa- tion to answer a number of questions about input displays containing two objects. This supports our contention that rich distributed representations containing coarse-coded con- junctive encodings can effectively perform binding. It is critical to appreciate that these distributed representations are highly efficient, encoding over 62400 unique input config- urations with only 200 hidden units. Furthermore, these representations are systematic,
in that they support generalization to novel inputs after training on a fraction of the input space. Despite these initial successes, more work needs to be done to extend this approach to other kinds of domains that require binding. One early example of such an application is the St John and McClelland (1990) sentence gestalt model, which was able to sequen- tially process words in a sentence and construct a distributed internal representation of the meaning of the sentence (the sentence gestalt). This model was limited in that it required extremely large numbers of training trials and an elaborate training control mechanism. However, these limitations were eliminated in a recent replication of this model based on the Leabra algorithm (O'Reilly & Munakata, 2000). We plan to extend this model to handle a more complex corpus of sentences to more fully push the relational binding capacities of the model. Finally, it is important to emphasize that we do not think that these low-order conjunctive representations are entirely sufficient to resolve the binding problems that arise in the cor- tex. One important additional mechanism is the use of selective attention to focus neural processing on coherent subsets of information present in the input (e.g., on individual ob- jects, people, or conversations). The interaction between such a selective attentional system and a complex object recognition system was modeled in O'Reilly and Munakata (2000). In this model, selective attention was an emergent process deriving from excitatory interac-
tions between a spatial processing pathway and the object processing pathway, combined with surround inhibition as implemented by inhibitory interneurons. The resulting model was capable of sequentially processing individual objects when multiple such objects were simultaneously present in the input."

We relate the performance of these methods, which use sam- ple paths, to the variance of estimates based on iid data. We derive the baseline function that minimizes this variance, and we show that the vari- ance for any baseline is the sum of the optimal variance and a weighted squared distance to the optimal baseline. We show that the widely used average discounted value baseline (where the reward is replaced by the difference between the reward and its expectation) is suboptimal. The second approach we consider is the actor-critic method, which uses an approximate value function. We give bounds on the expected squared error of its estimates. We show that minimizing distance to the true value function is suboptimal in general; we provide an example for which the true value function gives an estimate with positive variance, but the op- timal value function gives an unbiased estimate with zero variance. Our bounds suggest algorithms to estimate the gradient of the performance of parameterized baseline or value functions. We present preliminary exper- iments that illustrate the performance improvements on a simple control problem.
1 Introduction, Background, and Preliminary Results
In reinforcement learning problems, the aim is to select a controller that will maximize the average reward in some environment. We model the environment as a partially ob- servable Markov decision process (POMDP). Gradient ascent methods (e.g., [7, 12, 15]) estimate the gradient of the average reward, usually using Monte Carlo techniques to cal-

Sciences and Engineering at the Australian National University.
culate an average over a sample path of the controlled POMDP. However such estimates tend to have a high variance, which means many steps are needed to obtain a good esti- mate. GPOMDP [4] is an algorithm for generating an estimate of the gradient in this way. Compared with other approaches, it is suitable for large systems, when the time between visits to a state is large but the mixing time of the controlled POMDP is short. However, it can suffer from the problem of producing high variance estimates. In this paper, we investi- gate techniques for variance reduction in GPOMDP. One generic approach to reducing the variance of Monte Carlo estimates of integrals is to use an additive control variate (see, for example, [6]). Suppose we wish to estimate the integral of f : X ! R, and we know the
integral of another function ’ : X ! R. Since RX f = RX (f (cid:0) ’) +RX ’, the integral
of f (cid:0) ’ can be estimated instead. Obviously if ’ = f then the variance is zero. More generally, Var(f (cid:0) ’) = Var(f ) (cid:0) 2Cov(f; ’) + Var(’), so that if (cid:30) and f are strongly correlated, the variance of the estimate is reduced.
In this paper, we consider two approaches of this form. The ﬁrst (Section 2) is the technique of adding a baseline. We ﬁnd the optimal baseline and we show that the additional variance of a suboptimal baseline can be expressed as a weighted squared distance from the optimal baseline. Constant baselines, which do not depend on the state or observations, have been widely used [13, 15, 9, 11]. In particular, the expectation over all states of the discounted value of the state is a popular constant baseline (where, for example, the reward at each step is replaced by the difference between the reward and the expected reward). We give bounds on the estimation variance that show that, perhaps surprisingly, this may not be the best choice.
The second approach (Section 3) is the use of an approximate value function. Such actor- critic methods have been investigated extensively [3, 1, 14, 10]. Generally the idea is to minimize some notion of distance between the ﬁxed value function and the true value function. In this paper we show that this may not be the best approach: selecting the ﬁxed value function to be equal to the true value function is not always the best choice. Even more surprisingly, we give an example for which the use of a ﬁxed value function that is different from the true value function reduces the variance to zero, for no increase in bias. We give a bound on the expected squared error (that is, including the estimation variance) of the gradient estimate produced with a ﬁxed value function. Our results suggest new algorithms to learn the optimum baseline, and to learn a ﬁxed value function that minimizes the bound on the error of the estimate. In Section 5, we describe the results of preliminary experiments, which show that these algorithms give performance improvements.
POMDP with Reactive, Parameterized Policy
A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) consists of a state space, S, a control space, U, an observation space, Y, a set of transition probability matrices fP(u) : u 2 Ug, each with components pij (u) for i; j 2 S; u 2 U, an observation pro- cess (cid:23) : S ! PY , where PY is the space of probability distributions over Y, and a reward function r : S ! R. We assume that S; U; Y are ﬁnite, although all our re- sults extend easily to inﬁnite U and Y, and with more restrictive assumptions can be extended to inﬁnite S. A reactive, parameterized policy for a POMDP is a set of map- pings f(cid:22)((cid:1); (cid:18)) : Y ! PU j(cid:18) 2 RKg. Together with the POMDP, this deﬁnes the con- trolled POMDP (S; U; Y; P ; (cid:23); r; (cid:22)). The joint state, observation and control process, fXt; Yt; Utg, is Markov. The state process, fXtg, is also Markov, with transition prob-
abilities pij ((cid:18)) = Py2Y;u2U (cid:23)y(i)(cid:22)u(y; (cid:18))pij (u), where (cid:23)y(i) denotes the probability of
observation y given the state i, and (cid:22)u(y; (cid:18)) denotes the probability of action u given pa- rameters (cid:18) and observation y. The Markov chain M((cid:18)) = (S; P((cid:18))) then describes the behaviour of the process fXtg.
Assumption 1 The controlled POMDP (S; U; Y; P ; (cid:23); r; (cid:22)) satisﬁes: For all (cid:18) 2 RK there exists a unique stationary distribution satisfying (cid:25) 0((cid:18)) P((cid:18)) = (cid:25)0((cid:18)). There is an R < 1 such that, for all i 2 S, jr(i)j (cid:20) R. There is a B < 1 such that, for all u 2 U, y 2 Y and (cid:18) 2 RK the deriva- tives @(cid:22)u(y; (cid:18))=@(cid:18)k (1 (cid:20) k (cid:20) K) exist, and the vector of these derivatives satisﬁes kr(cid:22)u(y; (cid:18))=(cid:22)u(y; (cid:18))k (cid:20) B, where k (cid:1) k denotes the Euclidean norm on RK.

1 
Introduction and  motivation 
The goal of the population dynamics approach is to model the time course of the col(cid:173) lective activity of entire populations of functionally and dynamically similar neurons  in a compact way,  using a  higher descriptionallevel than that of single neurons and  spikes.  The usual observable at the level of neuronal populations is  the population(cid:173) averaged instantaneous firing  rate  A(t),  with  A(t)6.t being the number of neurons  in the population that release a spike in an interval [t, t+6.t).  Population dynamics  are formulated  in  such  a  way, that they match quantitatively the time  course  of a  given  A(t), either gained experimentally or by microscopical, detailed simulation. 
At  least  three  main  reasons  can  be  formulated  which  underline  the  importance  of  the  population  dynamics  approach  for  computational  neuroscience.  First,  it  enables the simulation of extensive networks involving a massive number of neurons 
and connections, which is  typically the case when dealing with biologically realistic  functional  models  that go  beyond  the single neuron level.  Second,  it increases the  analytical understanding of large-scale neuronal dynamics, opening the way towards  better control and predictive capabilities when dealing with large networks.  Third,  it enables  a  systematic  embedding  of the  numerous  neuronal  models  operating at  different  descriptional scales into a  generalized theoretic framework, explaining the  relationships,  dependencies  and derivations of the respective models. 
Early efforts on population dynamics approaches date back as early as 1972, to the  work of Wilson  and  Cowan  [8]  and  Knight  [4],  which  laid  the  basis  for  all  current  population-averaged graded-response  models  (see  e.g.  [6]  for  modeling  work  using  these models).  More recently, population-based approaches for spiking neurons were  developed,  mainly by Gerstner [3, 2]  and Knight  [5].  In our own previous work  [1],  we  have  developed  a  theoretical framework  which enables to systematize and sim(cid:173) ulate  a  wide  range  of models  for  population-based  dynamics.  It  was  shown  that  the equations of the framework produce results that agree quantitatively well  with  detailed  simulations  using  spiking  neurons,  so  that  they  can  be  used  for  realistic  simulations  involving  networks  with  large  numbers  of spiking  neurons.  Neverthe(cid:173) less,  for  neuronal populations composed of Integrate-and-Fire (I&F)  neurons, this  framework was only correct in an approximation.  In this paper, we  derive the exact  population  dynamics  formulation  for  I&F  neurons.  This  is  achieved  by  reducing  the  I&F  population  dynamics  to  a  point  process  and  by  taking  advantage  of the  particular properties of I&F neurons. 
2  Background:  Integrate-and-Fire dynamics 
2.1  Differential form 
We  start  with  the  standard Integrate- and- Fire  (I&F)  model  in  form  of the  well(cid:173) known differential equation [7] 
(1) 
which  describes  the  dynamics  of the  membrane  potential  Vi  of a  neuron  i  that  is  modeled  as  a  single  compartment  with  RC  circuit  characteristics.  The  membrane  relaxation time is in this case T  =  RC with R being the membrane resistance and C  the  membrane  capacitance.  The resting  potential  v R est  is  the  stationary potential  that is  approached in  the no-input  case.  The input arriving from  other neurons  is  described in form  of a  current ji. 
In  addition  to  eq.  (1),  which  describes  the  integrate  part  of the  I&F  model,  the  neuronal  dynamics  are  completed  by  a  nonlinear  step.  Every  time  the  membrane  potential Vi  reaches a fixed  threshold ()  from  below,  Vi  is  lowered by a fixed  amount  Ll  > 0,  and from the new value of the membrane potential integration according to  eq.  (1)  starts again. 
if Vi(t)  =  ()  (from  below)  . 
(2) 
At  the  same  time,  it  is  said  that  the  release  of a  spike  occurred  (i.e.,  the  neuron  fired),  and  the  time  ti  =  t  of this  singular  event  is  stored.  Here  ti  indicates  the  time of the  most recent spike.  Storing all the last firing  times, we  gain the sequence  of spikes  {t{}  (spike ordering index  j, neuronal index i).

Our approach is based on the use of factored linear value functions as an approximation to the joint value function. This factorization of the value function allows the agents to coordinate their actions at runtime using a natural message passing scheme. We provide a simple and efﬁcient method for computing such an approximate value function by solving a single linear pro- gram, whose size is determined by the interaction between the value function structure and the DBN.

In this paper we develop a connectionist approach to the problem of adapting speech recognition to the missing data case, using Recurrent Neural Networks. In contrast to methods based on Hidden Markov Models, RNNs allow us to make use of long-term time constraints and to make the problems of classification with incomplete data and imputing missing values interact. We report encouraging results on an isolated digit recognition task. 1. Introduction
Automatic Speech Recognition systems perform reasonably well in controlled and matched training and recognition conditions. However, performance deteriorates when there is a mismatch between training and testing conditions, caused for instance by additive noise (Lippmann, 1997). Conventional techniques for improving recognition robustness (reviewed by Furui 1997) seek to eliminate or reduce the mismatch, for instance by enhancement of the noisy speech, by adapting statistical models for speech units to the noise condition or simply by training in different noise conditions. Missing data techniques provide an alternative solution for speech corrupted by additive noise which make minimal assumptions about the nature of the noise. They are based on identifying uncorrupted, reliable regions in the frequency domain and adapting recognition algorithms so that classification is based on these regions. Present missing data techniques developed at Sheffield (Barker et al. 2000a, Barker et al. 2000b, Cooke et al., 2001) and elsewhere (Drygaglo et al., 1998, Raj et al., 2000) adapt the prevailing technique for ASR based on Continuous Density Hidden Markov Models. CDHMMs are generative models which do not give direct estimates of posterior
probabilities of the classes given the acoustics. Neural Networks, unlike HMMs, are discriminative models which do give direct estimates of posterior probabilities and have been used with success in hybrid ANN/HMM speech recognition systems (Bourlard et al., 1998). In this paper, we adapt a recurrent neural network architecture introduced by (Gingras & Bengio, 1998) for robust ASR with missing data.

Missing data techniques for Robust ASR

2.1 Missing data masks
Speech recognition with missing data is based on the assumption that some regions in time/frequency remain uncorrupted for speech with added noise. See (Cooke et al., 2001) for arguments to support this assumption. Initial processes, based on local signal-to-noise estimates, on auditory grouping cues, or a combination (Barker et al., 2001) define a binary missing data mask': ones in the mask indicate reliable (orpresent') features and zeros indicate unreliable (or `missing') features.
2.2 Classification with missing data
Techniques for classification with incomplete data can be divided into imputation and marginalisation. Imputation is a technique in which missing features are replaced by estimated values to allow the recognition process proceed in normal way. If the missing values are replaced by either zeros, random values or their means based on training data, the approach is called unconditional imputation. On the other hand in conditional imputation conditional statistics are used to estimate the missing values given the present values. In the marginalisation approach missing values are ignored (by integrating over their possible ranges) and recognition is performed with the reduced data vector which is considered reliable. For the multivariate mixture Gaussian distributions used in CDHMMs, marginalisation and conditional imputation can be formulated analytically (Cooke et al., 2001). For missing data ASR further improvements in both techniques follow from using the knowledge that for spectral energy features the unreliable data is bounded between zero and the energy in speech+noise mixture (Vizinho et al., 1999), (Josifovski et al., 1999). These techniques are referred to as bounded marginalisation and
bounded imputation. Coupled with a `softening' of the reliable/unreliable decision, missing data techniques produce good results on a standard connected-digits-in-noise recognition task: performance using models trained on clean data is comparable, and in severe noise superior, to conventional systems trained across different noise conditions (Barker et al., 2001).
2.3 Why recurrent neural nets for missing data robust ASR?
Several neural net architectures have been proposed to deal with the missing data problem in general (Ahmed & Tresp, 1993), (Ghahramani & Jordan, 1994). The problem in using neural networks with missing data is to compute the output of a node/unit when some of its input values are unavailable. For marginalisation, this involves finding a way of integrating over the range of the missing values. A robust ASR system to deal with missing data using neural networks has recently been proposed by (Morris et al., 2000). This is basically a radial basis function neural network with the hidden units associated with a diagonal covariance gaussian. The marginal over the missing values can be computed in this case and hence the resulting system is equivalent to the HMM based missing data speech recognition system using marginalisation. Reported performance is also comparable to that of the HMM based
speech recognition system. In this paper missing data is dealt with by imputation. We use recurrent neural networks to estimate missing values in the input vector. RNNs have the potential to capture long-term contextual effects over time, and hence to use temporal context to compensate for missing data which CDHMM based missing data techniques do not do. The only contextual information available in CDHMM decoding come from the addition of temporal derivatives to the feature vector. RNNs also allow a single net to perform both imputation and classification, with the potential of combining these processes to mutual benefit. The RNN architecture proposed by Gingras et al. (1998) is based on a fully-connected feedforward network with input, hidden and output layers using hyperbolic tangent activation functions. The output layer has one unit for each class and the network is trained with the correct classification as target. Recurrent links are added to the feedforward net with unit delay from output to the hidden units as in Jordan networks (Jordan, 1988). There are also recurrent links with unit delay from hidden units to missing input units to impute missing features. In addition, there are self delayed terms with a fixed weight for each unit which basically serve to stabilise RNN behaviour over time and help in imputation as well. Gingras et al. used this RNN both for a pattern classification task with static data (one input vector for each example) and sequential data (a sequence of input values for each example). Our aim is to adapt this architecture for robust ASR with missing data. Some preliminary static classification experiments were performed on vowel spectra (individual spectral slices excised from the TIMIT database). RNN performance on this task with missing data was better than standard MLP and gaussian classifiers. In the next section we show how the net can be adapted for dynamic classification of the spectral sequences constituting words.

RNN architecture for robust ASR with missing data

Figure 1 illustrates our modified version of the Gingras and Bengio architecture. Instead of taking feedback from the output to the hidden layer we have chosen a fully connected or Elman RNN (Elman, 1990) where there are full recurrent links from the past hidden layer to the present hidden layer (figure 1). We have observed that these links produce faster convergence, in agreement with (Pedersen, 1997). The number of input units depends on the size of feature vector, i.e. the number of spectral channels. The number of hidden units is determined by experimentation. There is one output unit for each pattern class. In our case the classes are taken to be whole words, so in the isolated digit recognition experiments we report, there are eleven output units, for 1' -9', zero' andoh'. In training, missing inputs are initialised with their unconditional means. The RNN is then allowed to impute missing values for the next frame through the recurrent links, after a feedforward pass. Where is the missing feature at time t, is the learning rate, indicates recurrent links from a hidden unit to the missing input and is the activation of hidden unit j at time t-1.
The average of the RNN output over all the frames of an example is taken after these frames have gone through a forward pass. The sum squared error between the correct targets and the RNN output for each frame is back-propagated through time and RNN"

1 Linear Relational Embedding
Our aim is to take a large set of facts about a domain expressed as tuples of arbitrary sym- bols in a simple and rigid syntactic format and to be able to infer other “common-sense” facts without having any prior knowledge about the domain. Let us imagine a situation in which we have a set of concepts and a set of relations among these concepts, and that our data consists of few instances of these relations that hold among the concepts. We want to be able to infer other instances of these relations. For example, if the concepts are the people in a certain family, the relations are kinship relations, and we are given the facts ”Alberto has-father Pietro” and ”Pietro has-brother Giovanni”, we would like to be able to infer ”Alberto has-uncle Giovanni”. Our approach is to learn appropriate distributed rep- resentations of the entities in the data, and then exploit the generalization properties of the distributed representations [2] to make the inferences. In this paper we present a method, which we have called Linear Relational Embedding (LRE), which learns a distributed rep- resentation for the concepts by embedding them in a space where the relations between concepts are linear transformations of their distributed representations.

In this paper, we propose the use of an established formalism from mathematical psychology, additive clustering, as a means of auto- matically constructing binary representations for objects using only pair- wise similarity data. However, existing methods for the unsupervised learning of additive clustering models do not scale well to large prob- lems. We present a new algorithm for additive clustering, based on a novel heuristic technique for combinatorial optimization. The algorithm is simpler than previous formulations and makes fewer independence as- sumptions. Extensive empirical tests on both human and synthetic data suggest that it is more effective than previous methods and that it also scales better to larger problems. By making additive clustering practical, we take a significant step toward scaling connectionist models beyond hand-coded examples. 1 Introduction
Many cognitive models posit mental representations based on discrete substructures. Even connectionist models whose processing involves manipulation of real-valued activations typically represent objects as patterns of 0s and 1s across a set of units (Noelle, Cottrell, and Wilms, 1997). Often, individual units are taken to represent specific features of the objects and two representations will share features to the degree to which the two objects are similar. While this arrangement is intuitively appealing, it can be difficult to construct the features to be used in such a model. Using random feature assignments clouds the relationship between the model and the objects it is intended to represent, diminishing the model's value. As Clouse and Cottrell (1996) point out, hand-crafted representations are tedious to construct and it can be difficult to precisely justify (or even articulate) the principles that guided their design. These difficulties effectively limit the number of objects that can be encoded, constraining modeling efforts to small examples. In this paper, we investigate methods for automatically synthesizing feature-based representations directly from the pairwise object similarities that the model is intended to respect. This automatic

After formalizing the problem, we will review existing algorithms that have been proposed for solving it. We will then investigate a new approach, based on combinatorial optimiza- tion. When using a novel heuristic search technique, we find that the new approach, despite its simplicity, performs better than previous algorithms and that, perhaps more important, it maintains its effectiveness on large problems. 1.1 Additive Clustering
We will formalize the problem of constructing discrete features from similarity information using the additive clustering model of Shepard and Arabie (1979). In this framework, abbreviated ADCLUS, clusters represent arbitrarily overlapping discrete features. Each of the k features has a non-negative real-valued weight w k , and the similarity between two objects i and j is just the sum of the weights of the features they share. If f ik is 1 if object
i has feature k and 0 otherwise, and c is a real-valued constant, then the similarity of i and"

Recently Hinton (1999) has introduced the Products of Experts (PoE) model in  which several individual probabilistic models for data are combined to provide an  overall model of the data. In this paper we consider PoE models in which each  expert is a Gaussian. It is easy to see that in this case the product model will  also be Gaussian. However, if each Gaussian has a simple structure, the product  can have a richer structure. Using Gaussian experts is attractive as it permits a  thorough analysis of the product architecture, which can be difficult with other  models, e.g. models defined over discrete random variables. 
Below we examine three cases of the products of Gaussians construction: (1) Prod(cid:173) ucts of Gaussian pancakes (PoGP) which give rise to probabilistic Minor Compo(cid:173) nents Analysis (MCA), providing a complementary result to probabilistic Principal  Components Analysis (PPCA) obtained by Tipping and Bishop (1999); (2) Prod(cid:173) ucts of I-factor PPCA models; (3) A products of experts construction for an AR(l)  process.

Motivated by studies of response prop- erties of neurons in the early cortical areas, we propose an encoding scheme that dispenses with absolute measures of signal intensity or contrast and uses, instead, only local ordinal measures. In this scheme, the structure of a signal is represented by a set of equalities and inequalities across adjacent regions. In this paper, we focus on characterizing the (cid:12)delity of this representation strategy. We develop a regularization approach for image reconstruction from ordinal measures and thereby demonstrate that the ordinal repre- sentation scheme can faithfully encode signal structure.

Roweis, Lawrence K. Saul, Geoffrey E. Hinton","High dimensional data that lies on or near a low dimensional manifold can be de- scribed by a collection of local linear models. Such a description, however, does not provide a global parameterization of the manifold—arguably an important goal of unsupervised learning. In this paper, we show how to learn a collection of local linear models that solves this more difﬁcult problem. Our local linear models are represented by a mixture of factor analyzers, and the “global coordi- nation” of these models is achieved by adding a regularizing term to the standard maximum likelihood objective function. The regularizer breaks a degeneracy in the mixture model’s parameter space, favoring models whose internal coor- dinate systems are aligned in a consistent way. As a result, the internal coor- dinates change smoothly and continuously as one traverses a connected path on the manifold—even when the path crosses the domains of many different local models. The regularizer takes the form of a Kullback-Leibler divergence and illustrates an unexpected application of variational methods: not to perform ap- proximate inference in intractable probabilistic models, but to learn more useful internal representations in tractable ones.
1 Manifold Learning
Consider an ensemble of images, each of which contains a face against a neutral back- ground. Each image can be represented by a point in the high dimensional vector space of pixel intensities. This representation, however, does not exploit the strong correlations between pixels of the same image, nor does it support many useful operations for reasoning about faces. If, for example, we select two images with faces in widely different locations and then average their pixel intensities, we do not obtain an image of a face at their average location. Images of faces lie on or near a low-dimensional, curved manifold, and we can represent them more usefully by the coordinates on this manifold than by pixel intensi- ties. Using these “intrinsic coordinates”, the average of two faces is another face with the average of their locations, poses and expressions.
To analyze and manipulate faces, it is helpful to imagine a “magic black box” with levers or dials corresponding to the intrinsic coordinates on this manifold. Given a setting of the levers and dials, the box generates an image of a face. Given an image of a face, the box deduces the appropriate setting of the levers and dials. In this paper, we describe a fairly general way to construct such a box automatically from an ensemble of high-dimensional vectors. We assume only that there exists an underlying manifold of low dimensionality and that the relationship between the raw data and the manifold coordinates is locally linear and smoothly varying. Thus our method applies not only to images of faces, but also to many other forms of highly distributed perceptual and scientiﬁc data (e.g., spectrograms of speech, robotic sensors, gene expression arrays, document collections).
2 Local Linear Models
The global structure of perceptual manifolds (such as images of faces) tends to be highly nonlinear. Fortunately, despite their complicated global structure, we can usually char- acterize these manifolds as locally linear. Thus, to a good approximation, they can be represented by collections of simpler models, each of which describes a locally linear neighborhood[3, 6, 8]. For unsupervised learning tasks, a probabilistic model that nicely captures this intuition is a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA)[5]. The model is used to describe high dimensional data that lies on or near a lower dimensional manifold. MFAs parameterize a joint distribution over observed and hidden variables:"

We show that the Fisher Information of this system grows linearly with the size of the system. We propose a bilinear readout model for extract- ing information from correlation codes, and evaluate its performance in discrimination and estimation tasks. It is shown that the main source of information in this system is the stimulus dependence of the variances of the single neuron responses."

We  propose  a  technique  that computes a  locally flexible  metric by means of Support Vector  Machines  (SVMs).  The maximum margin boundary found  by the  SVM is used to determine the most discriminant direction over the  query's  neighborhood.  Such  direction  provides  a  local  weighting  scheme  for  input  features.  We  present  experimental  evidence  of  classification  performance  improvement  over  the  SVM  algorithm  alone  and  over  a  variety  of adaptive  learning  schemes,  by  using  both simulated and real data sets."

Frey, Nebojsa Jojic","In previous work on transformed mixtures of Gaussians'' andtransformed hidden Markov models'', we showed how the EM al- gorithm in a discrete latent variable model can be used to jointly normalize data (e.g., center images, pitch-normalize spectrograms) and learn a mixture model of the normalized data. The only input to the algorithm is the data, a list of possible transformations, and the number of clusters to find. The main criticism of this work was that the exhaustive computation of the posterior probabili- ties over transformations would make scaling up to large feature vectors and large sets of transformations intractable. Here, we de- scribe how a tremendous speed-up is acheived through the use of a variational technique for decoupling transformations, and a fast Fourier transform method for computing posterior probabilities. For NN images, learning C clusters under N rotations, N scales,
N x-translations and N y-translations takes only (C + 2 log N)N

scalar operations per iteration. In contrast, the original algorithm takes CN

operations to account for these transformations. We give results on learning a 4-component mixture model from a video sequence with frames of size 320240. The model accounts for 360 rotations and 76,800 translations. Each iteration of EM takes only 10 seconds per frame in MATLAB, which is over 5 million times faster than the original algorithm."

Williams, John W. Zweck","We describe a neural network which enhances and completes salient closed contours. Our work is different from all previous work in three important ways. First, like the input provided to V1 by LGN, the in- put to our computation is isotropic. That is, the input is composed of spots not edges. Second, our network computes a well deﬁned function of the input based on a distribution of closed contours characterized by a random process. Third, even though our computation is implemented in a discrete network, its output is invariant to continuous rotations and translations of the input pattern."

S. Seung","Integration in the head-direction system is a computation by which hor- izontal angular head velocity signals from the vestibular nuclei are in- tegrated to yield a neural representation of head direction. In the thala- mus, the postsubiculum and the mammillary nuclei, the head-direction representation has the form of a place code: neurons have a preferred head direction in which their ﬁring is maximal [Blair and Sharp, 1995, Blair et al., 1998, ?]. Integration is a difﬁcult computation, given that head-velocities can vary over a large range. Previous models of the head-direction system relied on the assumption that the integration is achieved in a ﬁring-rate-based attractor network with a ring structure. In order to correctly integrate head-velocity signals during high-speed head rotations, very fast synaptic dynamics had to be assumed. Here we address the question whether integration in the head-direction system is possible with slow synapses, for example excitatory NMDA and inhibitory GABA(B) type synapses. For neural networks with such slow synapses, rate-based dynamics are a good approximation of spik- ing neurons [Ermentrout, 1994]. We ﬁnd that correct integration during high-speed head rotations imposes strong constraints on possible net- work architectures."

We ﬁnd that the new correction term signif- icantly improves the classiﬁcation results when tested on medium vo- cabulary speech recognition tasks. Moreover, the addition of this term makes the class comparisons analogous to an intransitive game and we therefore use several tournament-like strategies to deal with this issue.

1 Overview Artiﬁcial intelligence has investigated knowledge-based search techniques that allow one to solve search tasks in large domains. Most of the research on these methods has studied how to solve one-shot search problems. However, search is often a repetitive process, where one needs to solve a series of similar search tasks, for example, because the actual situation turns out to be slightly different from the one initially assumed or because the situation changes over time. An example for route planning tasks are changing trafﬁc conditions. Thus, one needs to replan for the new situation, for example if one always wants to display the least time-consuming route from the airport to the conference center on a web page. In these situations, most search methods replan from scratch, that is, solve the search problems independently. Incremental search techniques share with case-based planning, plan adaptation, repair-based planning, and learning search-control knowledge the property that they ﬁnd solutions to series of similar search tasks much faster than is possible by solving each search task from scratch. Incremental search techniques, however, differ from the other techniques in that the quality of their solutions is guaranteed to be as good as the quality of the solutions obtained by replanning from scratch.
Although incremental search methods are not widely known in artiﬁcial intelligence and control, different researchers have developed incremental search versions of uninformed search methods in the algorithms literature. An overview can be found in [FMSN00]. We, on the other hand, develop an incremental version of A, thus combining ideas from the algorithms literature and the artiﬁcial intelligence literature.

Latham,"Almost  two  decades  ago,  Hopfield  [1]  showed  that  networks  of  highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed  points, thus providing a substrate for  associative memory.  It is still  not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support  multiple attractors.  The main difficulty  is  that neuronal networks  in  vivo  exhibit  a  stable  background  state  at  low  firing  rate,  typ(cid:173) ically  a  few  Hz.  Embedding  attractor  is  easy;  doing  so  without  destabilizing  the  background  is  not.  Previous  work  [2, 3]  focused  on the sparse coding limit,  in which a  vanishingly small number of  neurons  are involved in  any memory.  Here  we  investigate the case  in which  the number of neurons  involved in  a  memory scales  with  the  number  of neurons  in  the  network.  In  contrast  to  the  sparse  coding limit,  we  find  that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly  with a stable background state.  Mean field theory is  used to under(cid:173) stand how the behavior of the network scales with its  parameters,  and simulations with analog neurons  are presented. 
One of the most important features  of the nervous  system is  its ability to perform  associative memory.  It is generally believed that associative memory is implemented  using  attractor networks  - experimental  studies  point  in that  direction  [4- 7],  and  there are virtually no competing theoretical models.  Perhaps surprisingly, however,  it is  still an open theoretical question whether attractors can exist  in realistic neu(cid:173) ronal  networks.  The  ""realistic""  feature  that  is  probably  hardest  to  capture is  the  steady firing  at low  rates - the background state - that is  observed throughout the  intact nervous system [8- 13].  The reason it is  difficult to build an attractor network  that  is  stable  at  low  firing  rates,  at  least  in  the  sparse  coding  limit,  is  as  follows  [2,3]: 
Attractor networks  are constructed by strengthening recurrent  connections among  sub-populations of neurons.  The strengthening must be large enough that neurons  within a sub-population can sustain a high firing rate state, but not so large that the  sub-population  can  be  spontaneously  active.  This  implies  that  the  neuronal  gain  functions - the firing rate of the post-synaptic neurons as a  function  of the average 
• http) / culture.neurobio.ucla.edu/ ""'pel 
firing rate of the pre-synaptic neurons - must be sigmoidal:  small at low firing rate  to  provide  stability,  high  at  intermediate firing  rate to  provide  a  threshold  (at  an  unstable  equilibrium),  and  low  again  at high  firing  rate to provide saturation and  a  stable  attractor.  In  other  words,  a  requirement  for  the  co-existence  of a  stable  background state and multiple attractors is that the gain function of the excitatory  neurons be super linear at the observed background rates of a few  Hz  [2,3].  However  - and this is  where  the problem  lies  - above  a  few  Hz  most  realistic gain function  are nearly linear or sublinear  (see, for  example, Fig.  Bl of [14]).  The  superlinearity requirement  rests  on  the  implicit  assumption  that  the  activity  of the  sub-population  involved  in  a  memory  does  not  affect  the  other  neurons  in  the  network.  While  this  assumption  is  valid  in  the  sparse  coding  limit ,  it  breaks  down  in  realistic  networks  containing  both  excitatory  and  inhibitory  neurons.  In  such networks,  activity among excitatory cells  results  in inhibitory feedback.

Yao, S. Nakamura","We present a sequential Monte Carlo method applied to additive noise compensation for robust speech recognition in time-varying noise. The method generates a set of samples according to the prior distribution given by clean speech models and noise prior evolved from previous estimation.

Minimum mean square error (MMSE) inference of the time-varying noise parameter is car- ried out over these samples by fusion the estimation of samples ac- cording to their weights. A residual resampling selection step and a Metropolis-Hastings smoothing step are used to improve calcula- tion e#ciency. Experiments were conducted on speech recognition in simulated non-stationary noises, where noise power changed ar- tificially, and highly non-stationary Machinegun noise. In all the experiments carried out, we observed that the method can have sig- nificant recognition performance improvement, over that achieved by noise compensation with stationary noise assumption. 1 Introduction
Speech recognition in noise has been considered to be essential for its real applica- tions. There have been active research e#orts in this area. Among many approaches, model-based approach assumes explicit models representing noise e#ects on speech features. In this approach, most researches are focused on stationary or slow-varying noise conditions. In this situation, environment noise parameters are often esti- mated before speech recognition from a small set of environment adaptation data. The estimated environment noise parameters are then used to compensate noise e#ects in the feature or model space for recognition of noisy speech. However, it is well-known that noise statistics may vary during recognition. In this situation, the noise parameters estimated prior to speech recognition of the utterances is possibly not relevant to the subsequent frames of input speech if en- vironment changes.
A number of techniques have been proposed to compensate time-varying noise ef- fects. They can be categorized into two approaches. In the first approach, time- varying environment sources are modeled by Hidden Markov Models (HMM) or Gaussian mixtures that were trained by prior measurement of environments, so that noise compensation is a task of identification of the underlying state sequences of the noise HMMs, e.g., in [1], by maximum a posterior (MAP) decision. This ap- proach requires making a model representing di#erent conditions of environments (signal-to-noise ratio, types of noise, etc.), so that statistics at some states or mix- tures obtained before speech recognition are close to the real testing environments. In the second approach, environment model parameters are assumed to be time- varying, so it is not only an inference problem but also related to environment statistics estimation during speech recognition. The parameters can be estimated by Maximum Likelihood estimation, e.g., sequential EM algorithm [2][3][4]. They can also be estimated by Bayesian methods. In the Bayesian methods, all relevant information on the set of environment parameters and speech parameters, which are denoted as #(t) at frame t, is included in the posterior distribution given observa- tion sequence Y (0 : t), i.e., p(#(t)|Y (0 : t)). Except for a few cases including linear Gaussian state space model (Kalman filter), it is formidable to evaluate the distri- bution updating analytically. Approximation techniques are required. For example, in [5], a Laplace transform is used to approximate the joint distribution of speech and noise parameters by vector Taylor series. The approximated joint distribution can give analytical formula for posterior distribution updating. We report an alternative approach for Bayesian estimation and compensation of noise e#ects on speech features. The method is based on sequential Monte Carlo method [6]. In the method, a set of samples is generated hierarchically from the prior distribution given by speech models. A state space model representing noise e#ects on speech features is used explicitly, and an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is con- structed in each sample. The prediction likelihood of the EKF in each sample gives its weight for selection, smoothing, and inference of the time-varying noise param- eter, so that noise compensation is carried out afterwards. Since noise parameter estimation, noise compensation and speech recognition are carried out frame-by- frame, we denote this approach as sequential noise compensation. 2 Speech and noise model
Our work is on speech features derived from Mel Frequency Cepstral Coe#cients (MFCC). It is generated by transforming signal power into log-spectral domain, and finally, by discrete Cosine transform (DCT) to the cepstral domain. The following derivation of the algorithm is in log-spectral domain. Let t denote frame (time) index. In our work, speech and noise are respectively modeled by HMMs and a Gaussian mixture. For speech recognition in stationary additive noise, the following for- mula [4] has been shown to be e#ective in compensating noise e#ects. For Gaussian mixture k t at state s t , the Log-Add method transforms the mean vector"

Referred  to  as  causal-model  theory,  this  theory  predicts  that  objects  are  classified  as  category  members  to  the  extent they  are  likely  to  have  been  produced  by  a categorys  causal  model.  On  this  view,  people  have  models  of  the  world  that  lead  them  to  expect  a  certain  distribution  of  features  in  category  members  (e.g.,  correlations  between  feature  pairs  that  are  directly  connected  by  causal  relationships),  and  consider  exemplars  good  category  members  when  they  manifest  those  expectations.  These  expectations  include  sensitivity  to  higher-order  feature  interactions  that emerge from the  asymmetries inherent in causal relationships. 
Research  on  the  topic  of categorization  has  traditionally  focused  on  the  problem  of  learning  new  categories  given  observations  of  category  members.  In  contrast,  the  theory-based  view  of  categories  emphasizes  the  influence  of  the  prior  theoretical  knowledge  that  learners  often  contribute  to  their  representations  of  categories  [1].  However, in  contrast to  models  accounting  for  the  effects  of empirical  observations,  there  have  been  few  models  developed  to  account for  the  effects of prior knowledge.  The  purpose  of  this  article  is  to  present  a  model  of  categorization  referred  to  as  causal-model  theory  or  CMT  [2,  3].  According  to  CMT,  people 's  know ledge  of  many  categories  includes  not only  features,  but  also  an  explicit representation  of the  causal mechanisms that people believe link the features  of many categories. 
In  this  article  I  apply  CMT  to  the  problem  of  establishing  objects  category  membership.  In  the  psychological  literature  one  standard  view  of  categorization  is  that  objects  are  placed  in  a  category  to  the  extent they  have  features  that  have  often  been  observed  in  members  of that category.  For example, an  object that has  most of  the  features  of  birds  (e.g.,  wings,  fly,  build  nests  in  trees,  etc.)  and  few  features  of  other  categories  is  thought to  be  a  bird. This  view  of categorization  is  formalized  by  prototype  models  in  which  classification  is  a  function  of the  similarity  (i.e. , number  of  shared  features)  between  a  mental  representation  of  a  category  prototype  and  a  to-be-classified  object.  However ,  a  well-known  difficulty  with  prototype  models  is  that  a  features  contribution  to  category  membership  is  independent  of the  presence  or  absence  of  other  features.  In  contrast ,  consideration  of  a  categorys  theoretical  influence  which  combinations  of  features  make  for  knowledge  acceptable  category  members.  For  example ,  people  believe  that  birds  have  nests  in  trees  because  they  can  fly , and  in  light  of this  knowledge  an  animal  that  doesnt  fly"

We present a statistical approach to increasing the efﬁciency of particle ﬁlters by adapting the size of sample sets on-the-ﬂy. The key idea of the KLD-sampling method is to bound the approximation error introduced by the sample-based representation of the particle ﬁlter. The name KLD-sampling is due to the fact that we measure the approximation error by the Kullback-Leibler distance. Our adaptation approach chooses a small number of samples if the density is focused on a small part of the state space, and it chooses a large number of samples if the state uncertainty is high. Both the implementation and computation overhead of this approach are small. Extensive experiments using mobile robot localization as a test application show that our approach yields drastic improvements over particle ﬁlters with ﬁxed sample set sizes and over a previously introduced adaptation technique."

We use decomposable triangulated graphs to depict the probabilistic independence of parts, but the unsupervised technique is not limited to this type of graph. In the new approach, labeling of the data (part assignments) is taken as hidden variables and the EM algo- rithm is applied. A greedy algorithm is developed to select parts and to search for the optimal structure based on the differential entropy of these variables. The success of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to generate models of human motion automatically from unlabeled real image sequences."

Ascoli, Alexei V. Samsonovich","Visual inspection of neurons suggests that dendritic orientation may be  determined both by internal constraints (e.g. membrane tension) and by  external vector fields (e.g. neurotrophic gradients). For example, basal  dendrites of pyramidal cells appear nicely fan-out. This regular  orientation is hard to justify completely with a general tendency to  grow straight, given the zigzags observed experimentally. Instead,  dendrites could (A) favor a fixed (“external”) direction, or (B) repel  from their own soma. To investigate these possibilities quantitatively,  reconstructed hippocampal cells were subjected to Bayesian analysis.  The statistical model combined linearly factors A and B, as well as the  tendency to grow straight. For all morphological classes, B was found  to be significantly positive and consistently greater than A. In addition,  when dendrites were artificially re-oriented according to this model, the  resulting structures closely resembled real morphologies. These results  suggest that somatodendritic repulsion may play a role in determining  dendritic orientation. Since hippocampal cells are very densely packed  and their dendritic trees highly overlap, the repulsion must be cell- specific. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying such specificity. 
1 Int r oduc t i on 
The study of brain dynamics and development at the cellular level would greatly benefit  from a standardized, accurate and yet succinct statistical model characterizing the  morphology of major neuronal classes. Such model could also provide a basis for  simulation of anatomically realistic virtual neurons [1]. The model should accurately  distinguish among different neuronal classes: a morphological difference between classes  would be captured by a difference in model parameters and reproduced in generated  virtual neurons. In addition, the model should be self-consistent: there should be no  statistical difference in model parameters measured from real neurons of a given class  and from virtual neurons of the same class. The assumption that a simple statistical model  of this sort exists relies on the similarity of average environmental and homeostatic  conditions encountered by individual neurons during development and on the limited  amount of genetic information that underlies differentiation of neuronal classes. 
Previous research in computational neuroanatomy has mainly focused on the topology  and internal geometry of dendrites (i.e., the properties described in “dendrograms”) [2,3].  Recently, we attempted to include spatial orientation in the models, thus generating 
2 
virtual neurons in 3D [4]. Dendritic growth was assumed to deviate from the straight  direction both randomly and based on a constant bias in a given direction, or “tropism”.  Different models of tropism (e.g. along a fixed axis, towards a plane, or away from the  soma) had dramatic effects on the shape of virtual neurons [5]. Our current strategy is to  split the problem of finding a statistical model describing neuronal morphology in two  parts. First, we maintain that the topology and the internal geometry of a particular  dendritic tree can be described independently of its 3D embedding (i.e., the set of local  dendritic orientations). At the same time, one and the same internal geometry (e.g., the  experimental dendrograms obtained from real neurons) may have many equally plausible  3D embeddings that are statistically consistent with the anatomical characteristics of that  neuronal class. The present work aims at finding a minimal statistical model describing  local dendritic orientation in experimentally reconstructed hippocampal principal cells. 
Hippocampal neurons have a polarized shape: their dendrites tend to grow from the soma  as if enclosed in cones. In pyramidal cells, basal and apical dendrites invade opposite  hemispaces (fig. 1A), while granule cell dendrites all invade the same hemispace. This  behavior could be caused by a tendency to grow towards the layers of incoming fibers to  establish synapses. Such tendency would correspond to a tropism in a direction roughly  parallel to the cell main axis. Alternatively, dendrites could initially stem in the  appropriate (possibly genetically determined) directions, and then continue to grow  approximately in a radial direction from the soma. A close inspection of pyramidal  (basal) trees suggests that dendrites may indeed be repelled from their soma (Fig. 1B). A  typical dendrite may reorient itself (arrow) to grow nearly straight along a radius from the  soma. Remarkably, this happens even after many turns, when the initial direction is lost.  Such behavior may be hard to explain without tropism. If the deviations from straight  growth were random, one should be able to “remodel” th e trees by measuring and  reproducing the statistics of local turn angles, assuming its independence of dendritic  orientation and location. Figure 1C shows the cell from 1A after such remodeling. In this  case basal and apical dendrites retain only their initial (stemming) orientations from the  original data. The resulting “cotton ball” s uggests that dendritic turns are not in dependent  of dendritic orientation. In this paper, we use Bayesian analysis to quantify the dendritic  tropism."

Shafee, William Bialek","We study properties of popular near–uniform (Dirichlet) priors for learn- ing undersampled probability distributions on discrete nonmetric spaces and show that they lead to disastrous results. However, an Occam–style phase space argument expands the priors into their inﬁnite mixture and resolves most of the observed problems. This leads to a surprisingly good estimator of entropies of discrete distributions.
Learning a probability distribution from examples is one of the basic problems in data analysis. Common practical approaches introduce a family of parametric models, leading to questions about model selection. In Bayesian inference, computing the total probability of the data arising from a model involves an integration over parameter space, and the resulting “phase space volume” automatically discriminates against models with larger numbers of parameters—hence the description of these volume terms as Occam factors [1, 2]. As we move from ﬁnite parameterizations to models that are described by smooth functions, the integrals over parameter space become functional integrals and methods from quantum ﬁeld theory allow us to do these integrals asymptotically; again the volume in model space consistent with the data is larger for models that are smoother and hence less complex [3]. Further, at least under some conditions the relevant degree of smoothness can be determined self–consistently from the data, so that we approach something like a model independent method for learning a distribution [4].
describe as the number of times ni each possibility is observed in a set of N =PK
The results emphasizing the importance of phase space factors in learning prompt us to look back at a seemingly much simpler problem, namely learning a distribution on a dis- crete, nonmetric space. Here the probability distribution is just a list of numbers fqig, i = 1; 2;(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) ; K, where K is the number of bins or possibilities. We do not assume any metric on the space, so that a priori there is no reason to believe that any qi and qj should be similar. The task is to learn this distribution from a set of examples, which we can i=1 ni samples. This problem arises in the context of language, where the index i might label words or phrases, so that there is no natural way to place a metric on the space, nor is it even clear that our intuitions about similarity are consistent with the constraints of a met- ric space. Similarly, in bioinformatics the index i might label n–mers of the the DNA or amino acid sequence, and although most work in the ﬁeld is based on metrics for sequence comparison one might like an alternative approach that does not rest on such assumptions. In the analysis of neural responses, once we ﬁx our time resolution the response becomes a set of discrete “words,” and estimates of the information content in the response are de-
termined by the probability distribution on this discrete space. What all of these examples have in common is that we often need to draw some conclusions with data sets that are not in the asymptotic limit N (cid:29) K. Thus, while we might use a large corpus to sample the distribution of words in English by brute force (reaching N (cid:29) K with K the size of the vocabulary), we can hardly do the same for three or four word phrases.
In models described by continuous functions, the inﬁnite number of “possibilities” can never be overwhelmed by examples; one is saved by the notion of smoothness. Is there some nonmetric analog of this notion that we can apply in the discrete case? Our intuition is that information theoretic quantities may play this role. If we have a joint distribution of two variables, the analog of a smooth distribution would be one which does not have too much mutual information between these variables. Even more simply, we might say that smooth distributions have large entropy. While the idea of “maximum entropy inference” is common [5], the interplay between constraints on the entropy and the volume in the space of models seems not to have been considered. As we shall explain, phase space factors alone imply that seemingly sensible, more or less uniform priors on the space of discrete probability distributions correspond to disastrously singular prior hypotheses about the entropy of the underlying distribution. We argue that reliable inference outside the asymptotic regime N (cid:29) K requires a more uniform prior on the entropy, and we offer one way of doing this. While many distributions are consistent with the data when N (cid:20) K, we provide empirical evidence that this ﬂattening of the entropic prior allows us to make surprisingly reliable statements about the entropy itself in this regime.
At the risk of being pedantic, we state very explicitly what we mean by uniform or nearly uniform priors on the space of distributions. The natural “uniform” prior is given by"

Concerned about making the best use of the available resources, we address the problem of efficiently estimating where adding extra resources is highly needed in order to improve the expected performance of the resulting policy. Possible application in reinforcement learning (RL) , when real-world exploration is highly costly, concerns the de(cid:173) tection of those areas of the state-space that need primarily to be explored in order to improve the policy.

Our algorithm retains the main virtues of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm—its guarantee of monotonic im- provement, and its absence of tuning parameters—with the added advantage of optimizing a discriminative objective function. The algorithm reduces as a spe- cial case to the method of generalized iterative scaling for log-linear models. The learning rate of the algorithm is controlled by the sparseness of the training data. We use the method of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to discover sparse distributed representations of the data.

Cadez, P. S. Bradley","Probabilistic mixture models are used for a broad range of data anal- ysis tasks such as clustering, classiﬁcation, predictive modeling, etc. Due to their inherent probabilistic nature, mixture models can easily be combined with other probabilistic or non-probabilistic techniques thus forming more complex data analysis systems. In the case of online data (where there is a stream of data available) models can be constantly up- dated to reﬂect the most current distribution of the incoming data. How- ever, in many business applications the models themselves represent a parsimonious summary of the data and therefore it is not desirable to change models frequently, much less with every new data point. In such a framework it becomes crucial to track the applicability of the mixture model and detect the point in time when the model fails to adequately represent the data. In this paper we formulate the problem of change detection and propose a principled solution. Empirical results over both synthetic and real-life data sets are presented.

Consider a data set D = fx1; x2; : : : ; xng consisting of n independent, identically dis- tributed (iid) data points.

The  algorithm  provides  a  computationally  efficient  approach  to  non(cid:173) linear  dimensionality  reduction  that  has  locality  preserving  prop(cid:173) erties  and  a  natural  connection  to  clustering.  Several  applications  are  considered. 
In  many  areas  of artificial  intelligence,  information retrieval  and  data mining, one  is  often  confronted  with intrinsically low  dimensional  data lying  in  a  very  high  di(cid:173) mensional space.  For example, gray scale  n  x  n  images of a  fixed  object taken with  a  moving camera yield data points in rn: n2 .  However , the intrinsic dimensionality of  the  space  of all  images  of t he  same object  is  the  number  of degrees  of freedom  of  the camera - in fact  the space  has the natural structure of a  manifold embedded  in  rn: n2 .  While  there  is  a  large  body  of work  on  dimensionality  reduction  in  general,  most  existing  approaches  do  not  explicitly  take  into  account  the  structure  of the  manifold  on  which  the  data  may  possibly  reside.  Recently,  there  has  been  some  interest  (Tenenbaum  et  aI,  2000 ;  Roweis  and  Saul,  2000)  in  the  problem of devel(cid:173) oping  low  dimensional  representations  of data  in  this  particular  context.  In  this  paper , we  present  a  new  algorithm and an accompanying framework of analysis for  geometrically motivated dimensionality reduction. 
The  core  algorithm  is  very  simple,  has  a  few  local  computations  and  one  sparse  eigenvalue  problem.  The  solution  reflects  th e  intrinsic  geom etric structure  of the  manifold.  The justification  comes from  the  role  of the  Laplacian  operator  in  pro(cid:173) viding  an  optimal emb edding.  The  Laplacian  of the  graph obtained  from  the  data  points may be viewed as an approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator defined  on  the  manifold.  The  emb edding  maps for  the  data come from  approximations to  a  natural  map  that  is  defined  on  the  entire  manifold.  The  framework  of analysis 
presented  here  makes  this  connection  explicit.  While  this  connection  is  known  to  geometers  and  specialists  in  spectral  graph  theory  (for  example , see  [1,  2])  to  the  best  of our  knowledge  we  do  not  know  of any  application  to  data  representation  yet.  The  connection  of the  Laplacian  to  the  heat  kernel  enables  us  to  choose  the  weights  of the graph in  a  principled  manner. 
The locality preserving character of the Laplacian Eigenmap algorithm makes it rel(cid:173) atively  insensitive  to outliers  and  noise.  A  byproduct  of this  is  that  the  algorithm  implicitly emphasizes the natural clusters in the data.  Connections to spectral clus(cid:173) tering  algorithms  developed  in  learning  and  computer  vision  (see  Shi  and  Malik ,  1997)  become  very  clear.  Following the  discussion  of Roweis  and  Saul  (2000) , and  Tenenbaum et  al  (2000),  we  note  that  the  biological  perceptual  apparatus  is  con(cid:173) fronted  with  high  dimensional stimuli from  which  it must  recover  low  dimensional  structure.  One might argue that if the approach to recovering such low-dimensional  structure  is  inherently  local , then  a  natural  clustering  will  emerge  and  thus  might  serve  as  the  basis for  the  development of categories  in biological perception."

Yuille","Bayesian belief propagation in graphical models has been recently shown to have very close ties to inference methods based in statis- tical physics. After Yedidia et al. demonstrated that belief prop- agation (cid:12)xed points correspond to extrema of the so-called Bethe free energy, Yuille derived a double loop algorithm that is guar- anteed to converge to a local minimum of the Bethe free energy. Yuille’s algorithm is based on a certain decomposition of the Bethe free energy and he mentions that other decompositions are possi- ble and may even be fruitful. In the present work, we begin with the Bethe free energy and show that it has a principled interpre- tation as pairwise mutual information minimization and marginal entropy maximization (MIME). Next, we construct a family of free energy functions from a spectrum of decompositions of the original Bethe free energy. For each free energy in this family, we develop a new algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to a local min- imum. Preliminary computer simulations are in agreement with this theoretical development."

Consider  the  model  Mii  learned  by  the  algorithm  using  ni  examples  in  step  i  (ii  =  (nl , ... ,nm)) , and the model  Moo  that would  be learned using in(cid:173) finite  examples.  Upper-bound  the loss  L(Mii' M oo ) between  them  as  a  function  of ii, and  then  minimize  the  algorithm's  time  com(cid:173) plexity f(ii) subject to the constraint  that L(Moo , Mii ) be at most  f  with  probability  at  most  8.  We  apply  this  method  to  the  EM  algorithm for  mixtures  of Gaussians.  Preliminary experiments on  a  series  of large data sets  provide evidence of the potential of this  approach. 
1  An  Approach to Large-Scale  Learning 
Large  data sets  make  it  possible  to  reliably  learn  complex  models.  On  the  other  hand,  they require large  computational  resources  to learn from.  While  in  the past  the factor limiting the quality of learnable models was typically the quantity of data  available,  in many domains today data is  super-abundant, and the bottleneck is t he  time  required  to  process  it.  Many  algorithms for  learning  on  large  data sets  have  been  proposed,  but  in  order  to  achieve  scalability  they  generally  compromise  the  quality of the results to an unspecified degree.  We  believe this  unsatisfactory state  of affairs  is  avoidable,  and  in  this  paper  we  propose  a  general  method  for  scaling  learning algorithms to arbitrarily large databases without compromising the quality  of the  results.  Our  method  makes  it  possible  to  learn  in  finite  time  a  model  that  is  essentially  indistinguishable from  the  one  that  would  be  obtained  using  infinite  data. 
Consider the simplest possible learning problem:  estimating the mean of a  random  variable  x.  If we  have a  very large number of samples,  most  of them  are  probably  superfluous.  If we are willing to accept an error of at most f with probability at most  8,  Hoeffding bounds  [4]  (for example)  tell  us that, irrespective of the distribution of  x,  only n  =  ~(R/f)2 1n (2/8) samples  are needed,  where R is  x's range.  We  propose  to  extend  this  type  of  reasoning  beyond  learning  single  parameters,  to  learning  complex models.  The approach we  propose consists of three steps: 

Derive  an  upper  bound  on  the  relative  loss  between  the  finite-data  and  infinite-data models,  as  a  function  of the  number of samples  used  in  each  step of the finite-data algorithm. 
Derive  an  upper bound  on  the  time  complexity of the learning algorithm, 

as  a function  of the number of samples used in  each  step. 

Minimize  the  time  bound  (via  the  number  of samples  used  in  each  step) 

subject to target limits on the loss. 
In  this  paper we  exemplify  this  approach  using  the  EM algorithm  for  mixtures  of  Gaussians.  In  earlier  papers  we  applied  it  (or  an  earlier  version  of it)  to  decision  tree  induction  [2J  and  k-means  clustering  [3J.  Despite  its  wide  use,  EM  has  long  been criticized for its inefficiency  (see discussion following Dempster et al.  [1]),  and  has been considered unsuitable for large data sets [8J.  Many approaches to speeding  it up have  been proposed  (see Thiesson et al.  [6J  for  a  survey) .  Our method can be  seen as  an extension of progressive  sampling approaches like Meek et al.  [5J:  rather  than  minimize  the total number of samples  needed  by  the algorithm, we  minimize  the  number  needed  by each step,  leading  to  potentially much  greater savings;  and  we  obtain guarantees that do not depend on unverifiable extrapolations of learning  curves. 
2  A  Loss  Bound for  EM 
In  a  mixture of Gaussians  model,  each  D-dimensional data point  Xj  is  assumed  to  have been independently generated by  the following  process:  1)  randomly choose a  mixture component k;  2)  randomly generate a point from it according to a Gaussian  distribution with mean f-Lk  and covariance matrix  ~k. In  this paper we  will  restrict  ourselves to the case where the number K  of mixture components and the probabil(cid:173) ity of selection P(f-Lk)  and covariance matrix for  each  component are known.  Given  a  training  set  S  =  {Xl, ... , X N },  the  learning  goal  is  then  to  find  the  maximum(cid:173) likelihood  estimates  of the  means  f-Lk.  The EM algorithm  [IJ  accomplishes  this  by,  starting from  some set  of initial means, alternating until convergence between esti(cid:173) mating the probability p(f-Lk IXj) that each point was generated by each Gaussian (the  Estep), and computing the ML estimates of the means ilk  =  2::;':1 WjkXj /  2::f=l Wjk  (the  M  step),  where  Wjk  =  p(f-Lklxj)  from  the  previous  E  step.  In  the  basic  EM  algorithm,  all  N  examples  in  the  training set  are  used  in  each  iteration.  The goal  in  this  paper  is  to  speed  up  EM  by  using  only  ni  < N  examples  in  the  ith  itera(cid:173) tion,  while  guaranteeing that  the  means  produced  by  the  algorithm  do  not  differ  significantly from  those that would  be obtained with arbitrarily large N. 
Let  Mii  =  (ill , . . . , ilK) be the vector of mean estimates obtained by the finite-data  EM algorithm (i.e.,  using ni examples in iteration i), and let Moo  =  (f-L1,  ... ,f-LK)  be  the vector obtained  using infinite  examples at each  iteration.  In  order to proceed,  we  need  to  quantify  the  difference  between  Mii  and  Moo .  A  natural  choice  is  the  sum  of the squared errors  between  corresponding  means,  which  is  proportional to  the negative log-likelihood of the finite-data means given  the infinite-data ones: 
L(Mii' Moo ) =  L Ililk  - f-Lkl12  =  L L lilkd  -"

Coughlan, Alan L. Yuille","We  describe  the  g-factor,  which  relates  probability  distributions  on image features  to  distributions on the  images  themselves.  The  g-factor  depends  only  on  our choice  of features  and  lattice  quanti(cid:173) zation and is  independent of the training image data.  We  illustrate  the importance  of the g-factor by analyzing how the parameters of  Markov Random Field (i.e.  Gibbs or log-linear) probability models  of images are learned from data by maximum likelihood estimation.  In particular, we study homogeneous MRF models which learn im(cid:173) age distributions in terms of clique potentials corresponding to fea(cid:173) ture  histogram  statistics  (d.  Minimax  Entropy  Learning  (MEL)  by  Zhu,  Wu  and  Mumford  1997  [11]) .  We  first  use  our  analysis  of the  g-factor  to  determine  when  the  clique  potentials  decouple  for  different  features .  Second,  we  show  that  clique  potentials  can  be  computed  analytically  by  approximating  the  g-factor.  Third,  we  demonstrate a  connection between this  approximation and the  Generalized Iterative Scaling algorithm (GIS),  due to Darroch and  Ratcliff  1972  [2],  for  calculating  potentials.

The chances 7rij are usually estimated  by the empirical sampling frequency nij In leading to a point es(cid:173) timate J(nij In) for the mutual information. To answer questions  like ""is J (nij In) consistent with zero?"" or ""what is the probability  that the true mutual information is much larger than the point es(cid:173) timate?"" one has to go beyond the point estimate. In the Bayesian  framework one can answer these questions by utilizing a (second  order) prior distribution p( 7r) comprising prior information about  7r. From the prior p(7r) one can compute the posterior p(7rln), from  which the distribution p(Iln) of the mutual information can be cal(cid:173) culated. We derive reliable and quickly computable approximations  for p(Iln). We concentrate on the mean, variance, skewness, and  kurtosis, and non-informative priors. For the mean we also give an  exact expression. Numerical issues and the range of validity are  discussed."

Colonius, A. Diederich","Multisensory response enhancement (MRE) is  the augmentation of  the  response  of a  neuron  to  sensory  input  of one  modality  by  si(cid:173) multaneous input from another modality.  The maximum likelihood  (ML)  model presented here modifies  the Bayesian model for  MRE  (Anastasio et al.)  by incorporating a decision strategy to maximize  the number of correct decisions.  Thus the ML model can also deal  with  the  important  tasks  of stimulus  discrimination  and  identifi(cid:173) cation in  the presence  of incongruent  visual  and auditory cues.  It  accounts  for  the  inverse  effectiveness  observed  in  neurophysiolog(cid:173) ical  recording  data,  and  it  predicts  a  functional  relation  between  uni- and bimodal levels  of discriminability that is  testable both in  neurophysiological and behavioral experiments."

Lagoudakis, Ronald Parr","We propose a new approach to reinforcement learning which combines least squares function approximation with policy iteration. Our method is model-free and completely off policy. We are motivated by the least squares temporal difference learning algorithm (LSTD), which is known for its efﬁcient use of sample experiences compared to pure temporal difference algorithms. LSTD is ideal for prediction problems, however it heretofore has not had a straightforward application to control problems. Moreover, approximations learned by LSTD are strongly inﬂuenced by the visitation distribution over states. Our new algorithm, Least Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) addresses these issues. The result is an off-policy method which can use (or reuse) data collected from any source. We have tested LSPI on several problems, including a bicycle simulator in which it learns to guide the bicycle to a goal efﬁciently by merely observing a relatively small number of completely random trials."
