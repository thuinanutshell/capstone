1  Modeling with Gaussian Processes 
Bayesian models which are based on Gaussian prior distributions on function spaces  are promising non-parametric statistical tools.  They have been recently introduced  into the Neural  Computation community  (Neal  1996, Williams &  Rasmussen  1996,  Mackay  1997).  To  give their basic definition,  we  assume that the likelihood of the  output  or  target  variable  T  for  a  given  input  s  E  RN  can  be  written  in  the  form  p(Tlh(s))  where  h  : RN  --+  R  is  a  priori  assumed  to  be  a  Gaussian  random field.  If we  assume fields  with  zero  prior  mean,  the statistics  of h  is  entirely  defined  by  the second order correlations C(s, S')  ==  E[h(s)h(S')], where E  denotes expectations

Previous approaches worked on features  derived from the call patterns of individual users. In this paper we present  a call-based detection system based on a hierarchical regime-switching  model. The detection problem is formulated as an inference problem on  the regime probabilities. Inference is implemented by applying the junc(cid:173) tion tree algorithm to the underlying graphical model.

Roweis","The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative pro(cid:173) cedure  for  maximum  likelihood  parameter  estimation  from  data  sets  with  missing  or  hidden  variables  [2].  It has  been  applied  to  system identification in linear stochastic state-space models,  where  the state variables are hidden from the observer and both the state  and  the  parameters  of  the  model  have  to  be  estimated  simulta(cid:173) neously  [9].  We  present  a  generalization  of the  EM  algorithm for  parameter estimation in  nonlinear dynamical systems.  The ""expec(cid:173) tation"" step makes use of Extended Kalman Smoothing to estimate  the state, while the  ""maximization""  step re-estimates the parame(cid:173) ters using these uncertain state estimates. In general, the nonlinear  maximization step is difficult because it requires integrating out the  uncertainty  in  the states.  However,  if Gaussian  radial  basis  func(cid:173) tion  (RBF)  approximators  are  used  to  model  the  nonlinearities,  the integrals  become  tractable  and the  maximization step  can  be  solved  via systems of linear equations. 
1  Stochastic  Nonlinear Dynamical Systems 
We  examine inference and learning in discrete-time dynamical systems with hidden  state  Xt,  inputs  Ut,  and  outputs  Yt. 1  The  state  evolves  according  to  stationary  nonlinear dynamics driven by the inputs  and by additive noise

where  w  is  zero-mean  Gaussian noise  with  covariance Q.  2  The outputs  are  non(cid:173) linearly related to the states and inputs by 
Yt  =  g(Xt, Ut)  + v 
(2) 
where  v  is  zero-mean Gaussian noise with  covariance R.  The vector-valued non lin(cid:173) earities f  and 9  are assumed to be  differentiable,  but otherwise arbitrary.  Models  of this  kind  have been examined for  decades  in  various communities.  Most  notably,  nonlinear state-space models form  one of the cornerstones of modern sys(cid:173) tems  and  control  engineering.  In this  paper,  we  examine these  models  within  the  framework  of probabilistic graphical models  and derive  a  novel  learning algorithm  for  them  based  on  EM.  With one exception,3  this  is  to  the  best  of our  knowledge  the first  paper addressing learning of stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems of the  kind  we  have described  within  the framework of the EM algorithm.  The classical approach to system identification treats the parameters as hidden vari(cid:173) ables, and applies the Extended Kalman Filtering algorithm (described in section 2)  to  the  nonlinear  system  with  the  state  vector  augmented  by  the  parameters  [5]. 4  This approach is  inherently on-line, which may be important in certain applications.  Furthermore,  it  provides  an estimate of the  covariance  of the  parameters  at  each  time step.  In contrast, the EM algorithm we  present is  a  batch algorithm and does  not  attempt to estimate the covariance of the parameters. 
There are three important advantages the  EM algorithm has  over the classical ap(cid:173) proach.  First, the EM algorithm provides a straightforward and  principled method  for  handing  missing  inputs  or  outputs.  Second,  EM  generalizes  readily  to  more  complex  models  with  combinations  of  discrete  and  real-valued  hidden  variables.  For example, one  can formulate EM for  a  mixture of nonlinear  dynamical systems.  Third,  whereas  it  is  often  very  difficult  to  prove  or  analyze  stability  within  the  classical on-line approach, the EM algorithm is  always attempting to maximize the  likelihood,  which  acts as a  Lyapunov function  for  stable learning. 
In the next sections we will describe the basic components of the learning algorithm.  For the expectation step of the algorithm, we infer the conditional distribution of the  hidden states using Extended Kalman Smoothing (section 2).  For the maximization  step  we  first  discuss  the  general  case  (section  3)  and  then  describe  the  particular  case  where  the  nonlinearities  are  represented  using  Gaussian  radial  basis  function  (RBF;  [6])  networks  (section 4). 
2  Extended Kalman  Smoothing 
Given  a  system  described  by  equations  (1)  and  (2),  we  need  to  infer  the  hidden  states from  a  history  of observed  inputs  and  outputs.  The  quantity  at the  heart  of this  inference problem is  the conditional density P(XtIUl,""""  UT, Yl,.' ""  YT),  for  1 ::;  t  ::;  T,  which  captures the fact  that the system is  stochastic and therefore our  inferences about  x  will  be uncertain. 
2The Gaussian noise assumption is  less restrictive for  nonlinear systems than for  linear 
systems since the nonlinearity can  be  used  to  generate  non-Gaussian  state noise. 
3The authors have just become aware that Briegel and Tresp (this volume) have applied  EM to essentially the same model.  Briegel  and Tresp's method uses multilayer perceptrons  (MLP) to approximate the nonlinearities,  and requires sampling from the hidden states to  fit  the  MLP.  We  use  Gaussian  radial  basis functions  (RBFs)  to  model  the  nonlinearities,  which  can be fit  analytically without sampling  (see section  4) . 
41t  is  important not  to  confuse  this use  of the  Extended Kalman  algorithm,  to simul(cid:173)
taneously  estimate  parameters  and  hidden  states,  with  our use  of EKS,  to  estimate just  the hidden state as  part of the E  step of EM. 
Learning Nonlinear Dynamics Using EM 
433 
For linear dynamical systems with  Gaussian state evolution and observation noises,  this conditional  density  is  Gaussian and  the recursive algorithm for  computing its  mean  and  covariance is  known  as  Kalman  smoothing [4,  8].  Kalman  smoothing is  directly analogous to the forward-backward algorithm for computing the conditional  hidden  state  distribution  in  a  hidden  Markov  model,  and  is  also  a  special  case  of  the belief propagation algorithm. 5  For  nonlinear systems  this  conditional  density  is  in  general  non-Gaussian and  can  in  fact  be quite  complex.  Multiple  approaches  exist  for  inferring the  hidden state  distribution  of such  nonlinear  systems,  including  sampling  methods  [7]  and  varia(cid:173) tional approximations [3].  We focus  instead in this paper on a classic approach from  engineering,  Extended Kalman  Smoothing  (EKS). 
Extended Kalman Smoothing simply applies Kalman smoothing to a local lineariza(cid:173) tion  of the  nonlinear  system.  At  every  point  x in  x-space,  the  derivatives  of  the  vector-valued functions f  and 9 define the matrices, Ax ==  M I x=x  and ex ==  ~ I x=x'  respectively.  The dynamics  are linearized  about  Xt,  the mean of the Kalman filter  state estimate at time t: 
The output equation  (2)  can be similarly linearized.  If the prior distribution of the  hidden state at t =  1 was  Gaussian, then, in this  linearized system, the conditional  distribution of the hidden state at any time t  given the history of inputs and outputs  will also be Gaussian.  Thus, Kalman smoothing can be used on the linearized system  to infer  this conditional distribution  (see  figure  1,  left  panel).

We  show that for all three of these models, the accuracy of the learned models can  be greatly improved by  augmenting a small number of labeled training images  with  a  large  set of unlabeled  images using  Expectation-Maximization.  This  is  important because it is often difficult to obtain image labels, while many unla(cid:173) beled images  are  readily  available.

Williams, Satinder P. Singh","Partially Observable Markov Decision  Processes  (pO ""MOPs)  constitute  an  important  class  of reinforcement  learning problems  which  present  unique theoretical and computational difficulties.  In  the absence of the  Markov property,  popular reinforcement  learning  algorithms  such  as  Q-Iearning  may  no  longer  be  effective,  and  memory-based  methods  which remove partial observability via state-estimation  are notoriously  expensive.  An alternative approach is  to seek a stochastic memoryless  policy  which  for  each  observation  of  the  environment  prescribes  a  probability  distribution  over  available  actions  that  maximizes  the  average  reward  per  timestep.  A  reinforcement  learning  algorithm  which  learns  a locally optimal  stochastic memoryless  policy has  been  proposed by Jaakkola,  Singh and Jordan,  but not empirically verified.

We model the dendrite as an  infinite linear cable, with noise sources distributed along its length.  The  noise sources we consider are thermal noise, channel noise arising from  the stochastic nature of voltage-dependent ionic channels (K+ and Na+)  and synaptic noise due to spontaneous background activity. We assess the  efficacy of information transfer using a signal detection paradigm where  the objective is to detect the presence/absence of a presynaptic spike from  the post-synaptic membrane voltage. This allows us to analytically assess  the role of each of these noise sources in  information transfer.

The MAP estimate minimizes uncertainty  in  all  respects:  cross-entropy  between  model  and  data;  entropy  of the  model ;  entropy  of  the  data's  descriptive  statistics.  Iterative  estimation  extinguishes  weakly  supported  parameters,  compressing and  sparsifying  the  model.  Trimming operators  accelerate  this  process  by  removing  excess  parameters  and,  unlike  most  pruning  schemes,  guarantee  an  increase  in  posterior  probability.  Entropic  estimation  takes  a  overcomplete  random  model  and simplifies  it,  inducing the  structure of relations  between  hidden  and  observed  variables.  Applied  to  hidden  Markov  models  (HMMs),  it  finds  a  concise  finite-state  machine  representing  the  hidden  structure  of a  signal.

Optimizing the information transmission through a single neuron in the  presence  of uniform, additive noise has an intuitive interpretation:  the most efficient representation  of the input uses every firing rate with equal probability.  An analogous principle for non(cid:173) spiking neurons has been tested experimentally by Laughlin [2], who matched the statistics

Here  we  demonstrate  generalization  using  a  novel  paradigm in motion discrimination  where learning has been previ(cid:173) ously  shown  to  be  specific.  We  trained  subjects  to  discriminate  the  directions  of  moving  dots,  and  verified  the  previous  results  that learning does not transfer from the trained direction to a  new  one.  However,  by  tracking  the  subjects'  performance  across  time  in  the new  direction, we  found  that their rate of learning doubled.  Therefore, learning generalized in  a  task previously considered too  difficult  for  generalization.  We  also  replicated,  in  the  second  ex(cid:173) periment, transfer following  training with  ""easy""  stimuli.  The specificity  of perceptual learning and  the  dichotomy  between  learning of ""easy""  vs.  ""difficult""  tasks were hypothesized to involve  different  learning  processes,  operating  at  different  visual  cortical  areas.  Here we show how to interpret these results in terms of signal  detection  theory.  With  the  assumption  of limited  computational  resources,  we  obtain  the  observed  phenomena  - direct  transfer  and change of learning rate - for increasing levels of task 'difficulty.  It  appears  that  human  generalization  concurs  with  the  expected  behavior of a  generic discrimination system."

Introduction:  Reinforcement  Learning for  Thading 
1  The  investor's  or  trader's  ultimate goal  is  to  optimize  some  relevant  measure  of  trading  system  performance ,  such  as  profit,  economic  utility  or  risk-adjusted  re(cid:173) turn.  In  this paper , we  propose  to use  recurrent  reinforcement  learning  to directly  optimize  such  trading  system  performance  functions ,  and  we  compare  two  differ(cid:173) ent  reinforcement  learning methods.  The first,  Recurrent  Reinforcement  Learning,  uses  immediate rewards  to train the trading systems, while the second  (Q-Learning  (Watkins 1989))  approximates discounted future rewards.  These methodologies can  be applied to optimizing systems designed  to trade a single security or to trade port(cid:173) folios .  In  addition , we  propose  a  novel  value function  for  risk-adjusted  return  that  enables  learning to be done  online:  the  differential  Sharpe  ratio. 
Trading system profits depend upon sequences  of interdependent decisions,  and are  thus  path-dependent.  Optimal  trading  decisions  when  the  effects  of transactions  costs, market impact and taxes are included require knowledge of the current system  state.  In  Moody,  Wu,  Liao  &  Saffell  (1998),  we  demonstrate  that  reinforcement  learning  provides  a  more  elegant  and  effective  means for  training  trading  systems  when  transaction costs are included , than do more standard supervised  approaches.

Though much theoretical progress has been made in recent  years in the area of rein(cid:173) forcement  learning, there have been  relatively few  successful,  practical applications  of the  techniques.  Notable  examples  include  Neuro-gammon  (Tesauro  1989),  the  asset  trader of Neuneier  (1996),  an elevator scheduler  (Crites  & Barto  1996)  and a  space-shuttle payload scheduler  (Zhang & Dietterich  1996). 
In  this  paper  we  present  results  for  reinforcement  learning  trading  systems  that  outperform the S&P 500 Stock Index over a 25-year test period, thus demonstrating  the presence of predictable structure in US  stock prices.  The reinforcement learning  algorithms compared here include our new recurrent  reinforcement learning  (RRL)  method  (Moody &  Wu  1997,  Moody  et  ai.  1998)  and  Q-Learning  (Watkins 1989). 
2  Trading  Systems and  Financial Performance Functions  2.1  Structure, Profit and Wealth for  Trading Systems  We  consider  performance functions  for  systems  that  trade  a  single  1  security  with  price  series  Zt.  The trader  is  assumed  to take only long,  neutral  or  short  positions  Ft  E  {-I , 0, I}  of constant  magnitude.  The  constant  magnitude  assumption  can  be  easily  relaxed  to  enable  better  risk  control.  The  position  Ft  is  established  or  maintained  at  the  end  of each  time  interval  t,  and  is  re-assessed  at  the  end  of  period  t + 1.  A  trade  is  thus  possible  at  the  end  of each  time  period,  although  nonzero  trading  costs  will  discourage  excessive  trading.  A  trading  system  return  R t  is  realized  at the end of the time interval  (t - 1, t]  and includes  the profit or loss  resulting from  the position F t - 1  held during that interval and any  transaction cost  incurred  at  time t  due to a  difference  in the  positions Ft- 1 and  Ft. 
In order to properly incorporate the effects of transactions costs, market impact and  taxes in  a  trader's decision making, the trader must have internal state information  and  must  therefore  be  recurrent.  An  example  of  a  single  asset  trading  system  that takes into account transactions costs and market impact has following decision  function:  Ft = F((}t; Ft-l. It)  with  It  = {Zt, Zt-1, Zt-2,··.; Yt, Yt-1, Yt-2, ... } where  (}t  denotes the (learned)  system parameters at time t and It  denotes the information  set  at  time t,  which  includes  present  and  past  values  of the  price  series  Zt  and  an  arbitrary number of other external  variables denoted  Yt.  Trading systems can  be  optimized by  maximizing performance functions  U 0 such  as  profit,  wealth,  utility functions  of wealth  or  performance ratios  like  the  Sharpe  ratio.  The  simplest  and  most  natural  performance  function  for  a  risk-insensitive  trader  is  profit.  The transactions cost rate  is  denoted  6. 
Additive profits are  appropriate  to consider  if each  trade  is  for  a  fixed  number  of shares  or  contracts  of  security  Zt.  This  is  often  the  case,  for  example,  when  trading small futures accounts or when trading standard US$ FX contracts in dollar(cid:173) denominated  foreign  currencies.  With  the  definitions  rt  = Zt  - Zt-1  and  r{  =  4 - 4-1  for  the price returns of a  risky  (traded)  asset  and a  risk-free  asset  (like T(cid:173) Bills) respectively,  the additive profit accumulated over T  time periods with trading  position size  Jl  > 0 is  then  defined  as:"

Zemel, Peter Dayan","Most theoretical and empirical studies of population codes make  the assumption that underlying neuronal activities is a unique and  unambiguous value of an encoded quantity. However, population  activities can contain additional information about such things as  multiple values of or uncertainty about the quantity. We have pre(cid:173) viously suggested a method to recover extra information by treat(cid:173) ing the activities  of the population of cells  as coding for  a com(cid:173) plete distribution over the coded quantity rather than just a single  value.  We  now  show how  this approach bears on psychophys(cid:173) ical and neurophysiological studies of population codes for mo(cid:173) tion direction in tasks involving transparent motion stimuli.  We  show that, unlike standard approaches, it is able to recover mul(cid:173) tiple motions from population responses, and also that its output  is consistent with both correct and erroneous human performance  on psychophysical tasks. 
A  population code can be defined  as a  set of units  whose  activities  collectively  encode some underlying variable (or variables).  The standard view is that popu(cid:173) lation codes are useful for accurately encoding the underlying variable when the  individual units are noisy.  Current statistical approaches to interpreting popula(cid:173) tion activity reflect this view, in that they determine the optimal single value that  explains the observed activity pattern given a particular model of the noise (and  possibly a loss function).  In our work, we have pursued an alternative hypothesis, that the population en(cid:173) codes  additional information  about  the  underlying  variable,  including  multiple  values and uncertainty.  The Distributional Population Coding (DPC) framework  finds the best probability distribution across values that fits the population activity  (Zemel, Dayan, & Pouget, 1998).  The DPC framework is appealing since it makes clear how extra information can  be conveyed in a population code.  In this paper, we use it to address a particu-

INTRODUCTION:  GAUSSIAN PROCESSES 
Within  the  neural  networks  community,  there  has  in  the  last  few  years  been  a  good  deal  of excitement  about  the  use  of  Gaussian  processes  as  an  alternative to  feedforward  networks  [lJ.  The  advantages  of  Gaussian  processes  are  that  prior  assumptions  about  the  problem  to  be  learned  are  encoded  in  a  very  transparent  way,  and  that inference-at least in  the  case  of regression  that  I  will  consider-is  relatively  straightforward.  One crucial  question  for  applications  is  then  how  'fast'  Gaussian processes learn,  i.e.,  how many training examples are needed to achieve a  certain level  of generalization performance.  The typical  (as  opposed to worst case)  behaviour is  captured in  the learning  curve,  which gives  the average generalization  error  €  as  a  function  of the  number  of training examples  n.  Several  workers  have  [2,3, 4J  or studied its large n asymptotics.  As I will illustrate  derived bounds on €(n)  below, however, the existing bounds are often far from tight;  and asymptotic results  will  not  necessarily  apply for  realistic  sample sizes  n.  My  main  aim  in  this  paper  is  therefore to derive  approximations  to  €(  n)  which  get  closer  to the true learning  curves than existing bounds, and apply  both for  small  and large n.  In  its  simplest form,  the  regression  problem  that I  am considering  is  this:  We  are  trying  to  learn  a  function  0*  which  maps  inputs  x  (real-valued  vectors)  to  (real(cid:173) valued scalar)  outputs O*(x) .  We  are given a set of training data D, consisting of n

input-output pairs (Xl, yt);  the training outputs Yl  may differ from the 'clean' target  outputs 9* (xL)  due to corruption by noise.  Given  a test input x,  we  are then asked  to come up with a prediction 9(x)  for  the corresponding output, expressed either in  the simple form  of a mean prediction 9(x)  plus error bars, or more comprehensively  in terms of a 'predictive distribution' P(9(x)lx, D).  In a Bayesian setting, we do this  by  specifying  a  prior  P(9)  over  our hypothesis  functions,  and a  likelihood  P(DI9)  with which each 9 could have generated the training data; from  this  we  deduce the  posterior distribution P(9ID)  ex  P(DI9)P(9).  In  the case of feedforward  networks,  where the hypothesis functions 9 are parameterized by a set of network weights, the  predictive distribution then needs to be extracted by integration over this posterior,  either by  computationally intensive  Monte  Carlo techniques  or  by  approximations  which lead to analytically tractable integrals.  For a Gaussian process, on the other  hand,  obtaining  the  predictive  distribution  is  trivial  (see  below);  one  reason  for  this  is  that the  prior  P(9)  is  defined  directly  over input-output  functions  9.  How  is  this  done?  Any  9  is  uniquely  determined  by  its  output  values  9(x)  for  all  x  from  the  input  domain,  and  for  a  Gaussian  process,  these  are  simply  assumed  to  have  a  joint  Gaussian  distribution  (hence  the  name).  This  distribution  can  be  specified  by  the  mean  values  (9(x))o  (which  I  assume to  be  zero  in  the  following,  as  is  commonly  done),  and  the  covariances  (9(x)9(x' ))o  =  C(x, x');  C(x, x')  is  called  the  covariance  function  of the  Gaussian  process.  It  encodes  in  an  easily  interpretable way prior assumptions about the function to be learned.  Smoothness,  for  example,  is  controlled  by  the behaviour of C(x, x')  for  x'  -+  x:  The  Ornstein(cid:173) Uhlenbeck (OU) covariance function C(x, x') ex  exp( -IX-X'l/l) produces very rough  (non-differentiable) functions, while functions sampled from the squared exponential  (SE)  prior  with  C(X,X')  ex  exp(-Ix - x' 12/(2l2))  are  infinitely  differentiable.  The  'length scale' parameter l, on the other hand, corresponds directly to the distance in  input space over which  we  expect  our function  to vary significantly.  More complex  properties  can  also  be encoded;  by  replacing l  with different  length scales  for  each  input component, for  example, relevant  (smalll) and irrelevant (large l)  inputs can  be  distinguished.  How does inference with Gaussian processes work?  I only give a brief summary here  and refer to existing reviews on the subject (see  e.g.  [5,  1])  for  details.  It  is simplest  to  assume  that  outputs  yare  generated  from  the  'clean'  values  of  a  hypothesis  function  9(x)  by  adding  Gaussian  noise  of  x-independent  variance  0'2.  The joint  distribution  of a  set  of training  outputs  {yd  and  the function  values  9(x)  is  then  also  Gaussian,  with covariances given by 
here I  have defined  an n  x n  matrix K  and x-dependent n-component vectors k(x).  The  posterior distribution  P(9ID)  is  then obtained by  simply  conditioning on  the  {Yl}.  It is  again Gaussian and has mean  and variance"

1  Introduction and background 
A  major problem  in  the  application  of neural  networks  to  real  world  problems is  the ex(cid:173) cessively long time required for training large networks of a fixed  architecture. Moreover,  theoretical results establish the intractability of such training in  the worst case  [9][4].  Ad(cid:173) ditionally,  the problem of determining the  architecture and size of the network required to  solve  a certain  task  is  left open.  Due  to  these  problems,  several  authors  have  considered  incremental algorithms  for  constructing the  network by  the  addition  of hidden units, and  estimation of each unit's parameters incrementally.  These  approaches  possess  two desir(cid:173) able  attributes:  first,  the  optimization  is  done  step-wise,  so  that  only  a  small  number of  parameters  need  to  be  optimized at  each  stage;  and  second,  the  structure  of the  network

is  established concomitantly with the learning, rather than specifying it in advance.  How(cid:173) ever,  until  recently these algorithms have been rather heuristic in  nature, as  no  guaranteed  performance bounds had been established.  Note that  while there  has  been  a recent surge  of interest  in  these  types  of algorithms,  they  in  fact  date back  to  work done  in  the  early  seventies (see [3]  for a historical survey). 
The first theoretical result establishing performance bounds for incremental approximations  in  Hilbert space, was given by Jones  [8].  This work  was  later extended by Barron [2],  and  applied to  neural network approximation of functions characterized by  certain  conditions  on  their Fourier coefficients.  The  work  of Barron  has  been  extended  in  two  main direc(cid:173) tions.  First, Lee et at.  [10]  have considered approximating general functions using Hilbert  space  techniques,  while  Donahue et al.  [7]  have  provided powerful  extensions of Jones'  and  Barron's results  to general  Banach spaces.  One of the  most impressive results of the  latter work is the demonstration that iterative algorithms can, in many cases, achieve nearly  optimal rates of convergence, when approximating convex hulls. 
While this paper is concerned mainly with issues of approximation, we  comment that it is  highly relevant to  the statistical  problem  of learning  from  data in  neural  networks.  First,  Lee et at.  [10]  give estimation error bounds  for algorithms performing incremental  opti(cid:173) mization  with  respect to  the  training  error.  Under certain  regularity  conditions,  they  are  able to achieve rates of convergence comparable to those obtained by the much more com(cid:173) putationally  demanding algorithm  of empirical  error minimization.  Moreover,  it  is  well  known  that  upper bounds  on  the  approximation  error are  needed  in  order to  obtain  per(cid:173) formance  bounds,  both  for  parametric  and  nonparametric estimation,  where  the  latter  is  achieved using  the  method of complexity regularization.  Finally,  as  pointed out by  Don(cid:173) ahue et al.  [7],  lower bounds on  the approximation error are crucial  in  establishing  worst  case speed limitations for learning. 
The main contribution of this paper is  as follows.  For functions belonging to  the Sobolev  class (see definition below), we establish, under appropriate conditions, near-optimal rates  of convergence for the incremental approach, and obtain explicit bounds on the parameter  values of the network.  The latter bounds are often crucial for establishing estimation error  rates.  In  contrast  to  the  work  in  [10]  and  [7],  we  characterize  approximation  rates  for  functions belonging to standard smoothness classes, such as  the Sobolev class.  The former  work establishes rates  of convergence with  respect to  the convex  hulls  of certain  subsets  of functions,  which do not relate in  a any  simple way to  standard functional classes (such  as  Lipschitz, Sobolev,  Holder, etc.).  As  far  as  we  are  aware,  the results reported here are  the  first  to  report on  such bounds for  incremental  neural  network procedures.  A detailed  version of this  work, complete with the detailed proofs, is available in  [13]. 
2  Problem statement 
We  make use  of the  nomenclature and definitions  from  [7].  Let H  be  a Banach  space of  functions  with norm  II  . II.  For concreteness we  assume henceforth that the  norm is  given  by  the  Lq  norm,  1 < q  < 00, denoted by II  . Ilq. Let linn H  consist of all  sums of the form  L~=l aigi , gi  E H  and arbitrary ai, and COn H  is  the set of such sums  with ai  E  [0,1]  and  L~=l ai = 1.  The distances, measured in  the  Lq  norm, from  a function f  are given by 
dist(1innH,f) =  inf {l lh - fllq  :  hE linnH},  dist(conH , f) =  inf {l lh - fllq  :  hE conH}. 
The linear span of H  is  given by  linH  = Un linn H,  while  the convex-hull of H  is  coH =  Uncon H. We  follow standard notation and denote closures of sets by a bar, e.g.  coH is  the  closure of the convex hull of H. In this work we focus on the special case where 
H  =  H1}  ~ {g  : g(x)  =  eCJ(aT x + b),  lei::;  1}, IICJ(·)llq  ::;  I},"

Lewicki, Terrence J. Sejnowski","A common way to represent a time series is to divide it into short(cid:173) duration blocks,  each of which is  then represented by a set of basis  functions.  A limitation of this approach, however, is  that the tem(cid:173) poral alignment of the basis functions with the underlying structure  in the time series is arbitrary.  We present an algorithm for encoding  a time series that does not require blocking the data.  The algorithm  finds  an efficient  representation by inferring the best temporal po(cid:173) sitions  for  functions  in  a  kernel  basis.  These  can  have  arbitrary  temporal  extent  and  are  not  constrained  to  be  orthogonal.  This  allows the model to capture structure in the signal that may occur  at arbitrary temporal positions and preserves the relative temporal  structure of underlying events.  The model is shown to be equivalent  to a  very sparse and highly over complete basis.  Under this model,  the mapping from  the data to the representation is  nonlinear,  but  can  be  computed  efficiently.  This form  also  allows  the  use  of ex(cid:173) isting methods for  adapting the basis itself to data.

Jacobs, Yoram Gdalyahu","A  key question in vision  is  how to represent our knowledge  of previously  encountered objects to classify new ones.  The answer depends on how we  determine  the similarity  of two  objects.  Similarity  tells  us how  relevant  each previously seen object is in determining the category to which a new  object belongs.  Here a  dichotomy  emerges.

1  Supervised Learning and  Non-Metric Distances 
How  can  one  represent  one 's  knowledge  of previously  encountered  objects  in  order  to  classify new  objects?  We study this question within the framework of supel vised  learning:  it is assumed that one is given a number of training objects, each labeled as  belonging to a category; one wishes to use this experience to label new  test instances  of objects.  This  problem emerges  both in  the modeling of cognitive  processes  and  in  many  practical  applications.  For  example,  one  might  want  to  identify  risky  applicants for  credit  based  on  past  experience  with clients  who  have  proven  to  be  good or  bad credit  risks.  Our  work  is  motivated by computer vision  applications. 
Most current computational approaches to supervised  learning suppose that objects  can  be  thought  of as  vectors  of numbers,  or  equivalently  as  points  lying  in  an  n(cid:173) dimensional space.  They further suppose that the similarity between objects can be  determined from  the Euclidean distance  between  these  vectors, or from some other  simple metric.  This classic notion of similarity as Euclidean or metric distance leads 
Classification in Non-Metric Spaces

to considerable mathematical and computational simplification . 
However,  work  in  cognitive  psychology  has  challenged  such  simple notions of sim(cid:173) ilarity  as  models  of human  judgment,  while  applications  frequently  employ  non(cid:173) Euclidean distances  to measure object similarity.  We consider  the need for  similar(cid:173) ity measures that are not only non-Euclidean , but that are non-metric.  We focus on  proposed similarities that violate one requirement of a metric distance, the triangle  inequality.  This  states  that  if we  denote  the  distance  between  objects  A  and  B  by  d(A , B) , then :  VA , B , C  : d(A, B) + d(B, C)  ~ d(A , C) .  Distances  violating the  triangle inequality must also be non-Euclidean. 
Data from  cognitive  psychology  has  demonstrated  that  similarity judgments  may  not  be  well  modeled  by  Euclidean  distances.  Tversky  [12]  has  demonstrated  in(cid:173) stances  in  which  similarity judgments may  violate  the  triangle inequality.  For  ex(cid:173) ample, close  similarity between  Jamaica and  Cuba and  between  Cuba and  Russia  does  not  imply close  similarity between  Jamaica and  Russia  (see  also  [10]) .  Non(cid:173) metric  similarity measures  are  frequently  employed  for  practical  reasons,  too  (cf.  [5]) .  In  part,  work  in  robust statistics  [7]  has shown  that methods that will survive  the  presence  of outliers, which  are extraneous  pieces  of information or  information  containing extreme errors, must employ non-Euclidean distances that in fact violate  the  triangle inequality ; related  insights  have spurred  the  widespread  use  of robust  methods in computer vision  (reviewed  in  [5]  and  [9]). 
We are interested in handling a wide range of non-metric distance functions,  includ(cid:173) ing  those  that are so  complex that they  must  be  treated  as  a  black  box .  However,  to be concrete,  we  will focus  here  on  two  simple examples of such  distances: 
median distance:  This  distance  assumes  that  objects  are  representable  as  a  set  of features  whose  individual  differences  can  be  measured,  so  that  the  difference  between  two  objects  is  representable  as  a  vector:  J = (d1 , d2 ,  .. . dn ).  The  median  distance  between  the two objects  is just the median value in  this  vector.  Similarly,  one can define a k-median distance by choosing the k'th lowest element in this list.  k(cid:173) median distances are often used in applications (cf.  [9]) , because they are unaffected  by the exact values of the most extreme differences  between  the objects .  Only these  features  that  are  most  similar  determine  its  value.  The  k-median  distance  can  violate  the triangle inequality  to  an  arbitrary degree  (i.e. , there  are  no constraints  on  the  pairwise distances  between  three  points) .  robust  non-metric  LP  distances:  Given  a  difference  vector  J,  an  LP  distance  has  the form: 
(1) 
and is  non-metric for  p < 1.  Figure  1  illustrates  why  these  distances  present  significant  new  challenges  in  su(cid:173) pervised  learning.  Suppose  that given  some datapoints  (two in  Fig.  1) , we  wish  to  classify  each  new  point  as coming from  the  same category  as  its  nearest  neighbor.  Then  we  need  to determine the Voronoi  diagram generated  by our data:  a  division  of the  plane  into  regions  in  which  the  points  all  have  the  same  nearest  neighbor.  Fig.  1 shows  how  the Voronoi diagram changes  with  the function  used  to compute  the distance between datapoints; the non-metric diagrams (rightmost three pictures  in  Fig.  1)  are more complex and  more likely  to make non-intuitive predictions.  In  fact , very  little is  known about  the computation of non-metric  Voronoi diagrams. 
We  now  describe  new  parametric methods for  supervised  learning with  non-metric

distances,  and review  non-parametric methods that we  described  in  [8]. 
2  Parametric methods:  what  should  replace the  mean 
Parametric  methods  typically  represent  objects  as  vectors  in  a  high-dimensional  space,  and  represent  classes  and  the  boundaries  between  them  in  this  space  us(cid:173) ing  geometric  constructions  or  probability  distributions  with  a  limited  number  of  parameters.  One  can  attempt  to  extend  these  techniques  to  specific  non-metric  distances,  such  as  the  median  distance ,  or  non-metric  LP  distances.  We  discuss  the  example  of the  mean  of a  class  below.  One  can  also  redefine  geometric  ob(cid:173) jects such  as  linear separators,  for  specific  non-metric distances.  However,  existing  algorithms for  finding  such  objects  in  Euclidean  spaces  will  no  longer  be  directly  suitable,  nor  will  theoretical  results  about  such  representations  hold.  Many  prob(cid:173) lems  are  therefore  open  in  determining  how  to  best  apply  parametric supervised  learning techniques  to specific  non-metric distances. 
1 
We analyze k-means clustering where each class is  represented  by its average mem(cid:173) ber;  new elements are then classified according to which of these  prototypical exam(cid:173) ples  is  nearest .  In  Euclidean space,  the mean is  the  point q whose  sum of squared  distances  to all  the class members {qdr=l  - (2:~1 d(ij, qi)2)2  - is  minimized.  Suppose  now  that  our  data  come  from  a  vector  space  where  the  correct  distance  is  the  LP  distance  from  (1).  Using  the  natural  extension  of the  above  definition,  we  should  represent  each  class  by  the  point  ij  whose  sum  of distances  to  all  the  class  members - (2:~=1 d(ij, qi)P) p  - is  minimal.  It is  now  possible  to  show  (proof  is  omitted)  that for  p  <  1  (the  non-metric cases),  the  exact  value  of every  feature  of the representative  point ij must have already appeared in  at least one element in  the  class.  Moreover,  the  value of these features  can be determined separately  with  complexity O(n 2 ),  and  total  complexity of O(dn 2 )  given  d features .  ij  is  therefore  determined  by  a  mixture  of up  to  d  exemplars,  where  d is  the  dimension  of the  vector  space.  Thus there  are efficient  algorithms for  finding  the  ""mean""  element of  a  class,  even  using certain non-metric distances. 
1 
We  will  illustrate  these  results  with  a  concrete  example using  the  corel  database,  a  commercial database of images pre-labeled  by categories  (such  as  ""lions""), where  non-metric distance functions have  proven  effective  in  determining the similarity of  images [1] .  The corel database is very large, making the use of prototypes desirable. 
We  represent  each  image  using  a  vector  of  11  numbers  describing  general  image  properties,  such  as color histograms, as described  in  [1] .  We consider  the Euclidean

Given  the first  45  classes, each  containing 100 images , we found their corresponding prototypes; we  then computed  the percentage of images in each class that are closest  to their own  prototype, using  either the Euclidean or the L 0.5  distance and one of the two prototypes.  The results  are the following:

Introduction and Background 
A  majority of problems in  science  and engineering have  to  be modeled  in  a  prob(cid:173) abilistic manner.  Even  if the  underlying  phenomena are  inherently  deterministic,  the complexity of these phenomena often makes a probabilistic formulation the only  feasible  approach from  the computational point of view.  Although quantities such  as  the mean, the variance, and possibly higher order moments of a random variable  have often been sufficient to characterize a particular problem, the quest for  higher  modeling accuracy,  and for  more realistic assumptions drives  us  towards modeling  the available random variables using their probability density.  This of course leads  us  to the problem of density estimation (see  [6]). 
The most common approach for  density estimation is the nonparametric approach,  where  the  density  is  determined according to  a  formula  involving the  data  points  available.  The most  common non  parametric methods  are the  kernel  density  esti(cid:173) mator,  also known as  the Parzen window  estimator  [4]  and the  k-nearest  neighbor  technique  [1].  Non  parametric density  estimation belongs to  the  class  of ill-posed  problems in  the sense that  small changes in the  data can  lead to large changes  in

the estimated density.  Therefore it is important to have methods that are robust to  slight changes in the data.  For this reason some amount of regularization is  needed  [7].  This regularization is embedded in the choice of the smoothing parameter (ker(cid:173) nel width or k).  The problem with these non-parametric techniques is their extreme  sensitivity to the choice of the smoothing parameter.  A  wrong  choice  can  lead  to  either undersmoothing or oversmoothing. 
In  spite of  the  importance of the  density  estimation  problem,  proposed  methods  using  neural  networks  have  been  very  sporadic.  We  propose  two  new  methods  for  density  estimation  which  can  be  implemented  using  multilayer  networks.  In  addition to being able to approximate any function to any given precision, multilayer  networks give  us  the flexibility to choose an error function  to suit our application.  The methods developed here are based on approximating the distribution function,  in contrast to most previous works which focus  on approximating the density itself.  Straightforward differentiation gives  us  the  estimate of the  density  function.  The  distribution  function  is  often  useful  in  its  own  right  - one  can  directly  evaluate  quantiles or the probability that the random variable occurs in a particular interval. 
One of the techniques is a stochastic algorithm (SLC), and the second is a determin(cid:173) istic  technique  based  on  learning  the  cumulative  (SIC).  The  stochastic  technique  will  generally  be  smoother  on  smaller  numbers  of  data  points,  however,  the  de(cid:173) terministic  technique  is  faster  and  applies  to  more  that  one  dimension.  We  will  present a result on the consistency and the convergence rate of the estimation error  for  our  methods  in  the  univariate  case.  When  the  unknown  density  is  bounded  and  has  bounded  derivatives  up  to order  K,  we  find  that  the  estimation error  is  O((loglog(N)/N)-(l-t»), where N  is the number of data points.  As  a comparison,  for  the kernel density estimator (with non-negative kernels), the estimation error is  O(N-4 / 5 }, under the assumptions that the unknown density has a square integrable  second  derivative  (see  [6]),  and that the  optimal kernel  width is  used,  which is  not  possible in practice because computing the optimal kernel width requires knowledge  of the  true density.  One  can  see  that for  smooth  density  functions  with  bounded  derivatives, our methods achieve an error rate that approaches O(N- 1 ). 
2  New Density Estimation Techniques 
To  illustrate our  methods,  we  will  use  neural  networks,  but  stress  that  any  suf(cid:173) ficiently  general  learning  model  will  do  just  as  well.  The  network's  output  will  represent  an  estimate  of  the  distribution  function,  and  its  derivative  will  be  an  estimate of the density.  We  will  now  proceed to a  description of the two methods. 
2.1  SLC  (Stochastic Learning of the Cumulative) 
Let  Xn  E  R,  n  =  1, ... , N  be  the  data points.  Let  the  underlying  density  be  g(x)  and its distribution function  G(x) = J~oog(t)dt.  Let  the neural network output be  H (x, w), where w represents the set of weights of the network.  Ideally, after training  the neural network,  we  would like to have H (x, w)  =  G (x).  It can easily be shown  that the density of the random variable G(x)  (x  being generated according to g(x))  is  uniform  in  [0,1].  Thus,  if  H(x,w)  is  to  be  as  close  as  possible  to  G(x),  then  the network output should have a  density that is  close to uniform in  [0,1].  This is  what  our goal  will be.  We  will  attempt to train the  network  such  that  its output  density  is  uniform,  then  the  network  mapping  should  represent  the  distribution  function  G(x).  The basic idea behind the proposed algorithm is  to use  the N  data  points  as  inputs  to  the network.  For every  training cycle,  we  generate a  different  set of N  network targets randomly from a  uniform distribution in [0, 1],  and adjust 
524

the weights  to map the data points  (sorted in ascending order)  to these  generated  targets  (also sorted in ascending order).  Thus we  are training the network to map  the data to a  uniform distribution. 
Before describing the steps of the algorithm, we note that the resulting network has  to represent a monotonically non decreasing mapping, otherwise it will not represent  a  legitimate distribution  function.  In  our  simulations,  we  used  a  hint  penalty  to  enforce monotonicity [5].  The algorithm is  as follows. 

Let  Xl  S  X2  S  ...  S  XN  be  the  data  points.  Set  t  =  1,  where  t  is  the 

training cycle number.  Initialize the weights  (usually randomly)  to w(l). 

Generate randomly from a uniform distribution in  [0,1]  N  points (and sort 

them):  UI  S U2  S  '""  S UN·  The point Un  is  the target output for  X n·  3.  Adjust the network weights according to the backpropagation scheme:

Sutton, Satinder P. Singh, Doina Precup, Balaraman Ravindran","In robotics and other control applications it is commonplace to have a pre(cid:173) existing  set  of controllers  for  solving  subtasks,  perhaps  hand-crafted  or  previously learned or planned, and still face  a difficult problem of how to  choose and switch among the controllers to solve an overall task as well as  possible.  In this paper we present a framework based on Markov decision  processes and semi-Markov decision processes for phrasing this problem,  a basic theorem regarding the improvement in performance that can be ob(cid:173) tained by switching flexibly between given controllers, and example appli(cid:173) cations of the theorem.  In particular, we show how an  agent can plan with  these high-level controllers and then use the results of such planning to find  an even better plan, by modifying the existing controllers, with negligible  additional cost and no re-planning. In one of our examples, the complexity  of the problem is  reduced from  24 billion state-action pairs to  less than a  million state-controller pairs. 
In many applications, solutions to parts of a task are known, either because they were hand(cid:173) crafted  by  people  or because  they  were  previously  learned  or  planned.  For  example,  in  robotics applications, there may exist controllers for moving joints to  positions,  picking up  objects, controlling eye movements, or navigating along hallways.  More generally, an intelli(cid:173) gent system may have available to it several temporally extended courses of action to choose  from.  In such cases, a key challenge is  to  take full  advantage of the existing temporally ex(cid:173) tended actions, to choose or switch among them effectively, and to plan at their level rather  than at the level of individual actions. 
Recently, several researchers have begun to address these challenges within the framework of  reinforcement learning and Markov decision processes (e.g., Singh,  1992; Kaelbling,  1993;  Dayan & Hinton,  1993; Thrun and Schwartz,  1995;  Sutton,  1995;  Dietterich,  1998; Parr &  Russell,  1998;  McGovern, Sutton & Fagg,  1997).  Common to much of this recent work is  the  modeling  of a  temporally  extended action  as  a  policy  (controller)  and  a  condition  for  terminating,  which  we  together refer to  as  an  option  (Sutton,  Precup &  Singh,  1998).  In  this paper we consider the problem of effectively combining given  options into  one overall  policy, generalizing prior work by Kaelbling (1993).  Sections  1-3 introduce the framework;  our new results are in Sections 4 and 5.

Neurons  exhibit  complex  dynamic  behavior  that  is  not  directly  revealed  by  their  electrical  behavior,  but  is  incorporated  in  biochemical  signal  transduction  path(cid:173) ways.  This is  an important basis for  plasticity of neural  networks.  The area of the  brain to which  the baroreceptor afferents  project is  the nucleus of tractus solitarus  (NTS).  The neurons in the NTS  are  rich  with  diverse receptors for  signaling path(cid:173) ways.  It  is  logical  that  this  richness  and  diversity  playa crucial  role  in  the signal  processing  that  occurs  here.  Hormonal  and  neurotransmitter signals  can  activate  signal  transduction  pathways  in  the  cell,  which  result  in  physical  modification  of  some components of a cell, or altered gene regulation.  Fuxe et al  [4]  have shown the  presence of the angiotensin 11/ AT!  receptor pathway in NTS  neurons, and Herbert  [5]  has demonstrated its ability to affect the baroreflex. 
To  develop understanding of the effects of biochemical pathways,  a detailed kinetic  model  of the  angiotensin/AT!  pathway  was  developed.  Certain  features  of  this  model and the baroreflex have interesting characteristics from  a control engineering  perspective.  These  features  have  been  used  to  develop  a  novel  control  strategy.  The resulting control algorithm utilizes a proportional controller that intermittently  invokes  integral  action  to  achieve  set-point  matching.  Thus  the  controller  will  be  labeled PII. 
The  use  of integral  control  is  popular  as  it  guarantees  cancellation  of offsets  and  ensures  exact  set-point  matching.  However,  the  use  of integral  control  does  have  drawbacks.  It  introduces  significant  lag  in  the  feedback  system,  which  limits  the  bandwidth of the system.  Increasing the integral gain, in order to improve response  time,  can  lead  to  systems  with  excessive  overshoot,  excessive  settling  times,  and  less  robustness  to  plant  changes  or  uncertainty.  Many  processes  in  the  chemical  industry  have  a  steady-state  response  curve  with  a  maximum  and  frequently,  the  optimal operating condition is  at this peak.  Unfortunately,  any controller with true  integral action will  be unstable at this operating point. 
In a crude sense, the integrator learns the constant control action required to achieve  set-point matching.  If the integral control is viewed as a simple learning device, than  a  logical  step  is  to remove it from  the feedback  loop  once  the  necessary  offset  has  been learned.  If the offset is  being successfully compensated for,  only noise remains  as a source for  learning.  It has been well established that learning based on nothing  but  noise  leads  to undesirable  results.  The maxim,  'garbage in,  garbage out'  will  apply.  Without integral control,  the  proportional controller  can be made more  ag(cid:173) gressive while maintaining stability margins and/or control actions at similar levels.  This control strategy will  be appropriate for  plants with infrequent step changes in  set-points or loads.  The challenge becomes deciding when,  and how  to perform this  switching so  that the resulting controller provides significant improvements. 
1  Angiotensin III ATI receptor  Signal Transduction Model 
Regulation of blood pressure is  a vital control problem in mammals.  Blood pressure  is  sensed by stretch sensitive  cells  in  the aortic  arch and carotid sinus.  These cells  transmit signals to neurons in the NTS which  are combined with other signals from  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  resulting  in  changes  to the  cardiac output  and  vascular tone [6].  This control is  implemented by two  parallel systems in  the CNS,  the  sympathetic  and  parasympathetic  nervous  systems.  The  sympathetic  system  primarily affects  the vascular tone  and the parasympathetic system affects  cardiac  output  [7].  Cardiac  control  can  have  a  larger  and  faster  effect,  but  long  term  application of this control is  injurious to the overall health of the animal.  Pottman  et  al  [2]  have  suggested  that  these  two  systems  separately  control  for  long  term  set-point control and fast  disturbance rejection.

One  receptor  in  NTS  neuronal  cells  is  the  AT1  receptor  which  binds  Angiotensin  II.  The  NTS  is  located in  the brain stem where  much of the  processing of the au(cid:173) tonomic regulatory systems reside.  Angiotensin infusion in this region of the brain  has  been  shown  to  significantly  affect  blood  pressure  control.  In  order  to  under(cid:173) stand  this  aspect  of neuronal  behavior,  a  detailed  kinetic  model  of this  signaling  pathway  was  developed.  The  pathway is  presented  in  Figure  2.  The outputs  can  be  considered  to  be  the  concentrations  of Gq·GTP,  GO-y,  activated  protein  kinase  C,  and/or calmodulin dependent  protein kinase. 
Several reactions  in  the cascade are of interest.  The binding of phospholipase C  is  significantly  slower  than  the  other  steps  in  the  reaction.  This  can  be  modeled  as  a  first  order  transfer  function  with  a  long  time  constant  or  as  a  pure  integrator.  The  IP3 receptor  is  a  ligand  gated  channel  on  the  membrane  of the  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER).  As  Figure  2  shows,  when  IP3  binds  to  this  receptor,  calcium  is  released  from  the  ER  into  the  cells  cytoplasm.  However  the  IP3  receptor  also  has  2  binding  sites  on  its  cytoplasmic  domain  for  binding  calcium.  The  first  has  relatively  fast  dynamics  and  causes  a  substantial  increase  in  the  channel  opening.  The second calcium  binding site has slower  dynamics  and inactivates  the  channel.  The effect of this first  binding site is to introduce positive feedback into the model.  In traditional control literature, positive feedback is  generally undesirable.  Thus it  is  very interesting to see  positive feedback in neuronal  control systems. 
A typical surface response for  the model,  comparing the time response of activated  calmodulin  versus  the  peak  concentration  of  a  pulse  of  angiotensin,  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  results  are  consistent  with  behavior  of  cells  measured  by  Li  and  Guyenet  [8].  The  output  level  is  seen  to  abruptly  rise  after  a  delay,  which  is  a  decreasing function of the magnitude of the input.  Unlike a linear system, both the  magnitude and speed of the response of the system are functions  of the magnitude  of the  input.  Further,  the  relaxing of the system to  its  equilibrium  is  a  very slow  response  as  compared  to  its  activation.  This  behavior  can  be  attributed  to  the  positive  feedback  response  inherent  to  the  IP3  receptor.  The  effect  of  the  slow  dynamics of the phospholipase C binding,  and the IP3 receptor dynamics results in  an activation behavior similar to a threshold detector on the integrated input signal.  However, removal of the input results in a slow recovery back to zero.  The activation  of the calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase  can lead to phosphorilation of  channels  that result  in  synaptic conductance changes that are functionally  related  to  the  amount  of activated  kinase.  The  activation  of calcium  calmodulin  can  also  lead to changes in gene regulation that could potentially result in long term changes  in  the neurons  synaptic conductances. 
2  Proportional with Intermittent Integral  Control 
Key features  from  the model  that are incorporated in  the control  law  are: 

separate controllers for  set-point control and disturbance attenuation;  2.  activation of set-point controller when integrated error exceeds threshold;  3.  strength of integral  action  when  activated  will  be  a  function  of the  speed 

with  which  activation was  achieved; 

smooth removal of integral action,  without disruption of control action. 

The PII controller begins initially as a proportional controller with a nominal offset  added  to  its  output.  The  integrated  error  is  monitored.  The  integral  controller  is  turned  on  when  the  integrated  error  exceeds  a  threshold.  Once  the  integral  control action is  activated, it remains active as  long as the error is  excessive.  Once  the  error  is  not  significant,  then  the  integral  control  action  can  be  removed  in  a

By reformulating the face recognition problem and re(cid:173) interpreting the output of the SVM classifier. we developed a SVM -based  face recognition algorithm.  The face recognition problem is formulated  as a problem in difference space.  which models dissimilarities between  two facial images. In difference space we formulate face recognition as a  two class problem.  The classes are:  dissimilarities between faces  of the  same person.  and dissimilarities between faces  of different people.  By  modifying the interpretation of the decision surface generated by SVM.  we generated a similarity metric between faces  that is learned from ex(cid:173) amples of differences between faces.  The SVM-based algorithm is com(cid:173) pared with a principal component analysis (PeA) based algorithm on a  difficult set of images from the FEREf database.

Latham","Gain  control  by  divisive  inhibition,  a.k.a.  divisive  normalization,  has  been  proposed  to  be  a  general  mechanism  throughout  the  vi(cid:173) sual  cortex.  We  explore  in  this  study  the  statistical  properties  of this  normalization in  the  presence  of noise.  Using  simulations,  we  show  that divisive  normalization is  a  close  approximation to  a  maximum likelihood estimator, which, in the context of population  coding, is the same as an ideal observer.  We also demonstrate ana(cid:173) lytically that this is  a general property of a  large class of nonlinear  recurrent  networks  with  line  attractors.  Our  work  suggests  that  divisive  normalization  plays  a  critical  role  in  noise  filtering,  and  that every cortical layer may be an ideal observer of the activity in  the preceding  layer. 
Information  processing  in  the  cortex  is  often  formalized  as  a  sequence  of a  linear  stages followed  by  a  nonlinearity.  In the visual cortex,  the nonlinearity is  best de(cid:173) scribed by squaring combined with a divisive pooling of local activities.  The divisive  part of the nonlinearity has  been  extensively studied by  Heeger  and colleagues  [1],  and several authors have explored the role of this normalization in the computation  of high  order visual features  such  as  orientation of edges or first  and  second order  motion[ 4].  We show in this paper that divisive normalization can also playa role in  noise filtering.  More specifically, we demonstrate through simulations that networks  implementing this normalization come close to performing maximum likelihood es(cid:173) timation.  We  then demonstrate analytically that the ability  to  perform maximum  likelihood estimation, and thus efficiently extract information from  a  population of  noisy neurons,  is  a  property exhibited  by  a  large class of networks. 
Maximum  likelihood  estimation  is  a  framework  commonly  used  in  the  theory  of  ideal observers.  A recent example comes from the work of Itti et al.,  1998, who have  shown  that it  is  possible  to  account  for  the behavior of human  subjects  in simple  discrimination  tasks.  Their  model  comprised  two  distinct  stages:  1)  a  network

which  models  the noisy  response of neurons  with  tuning  curves to  orientation and  spatial frequency  combined with divisive normalization, and 2)  an ideal observer (a  maximum likelihood estimator)  to read out the population activity of the network. 
Our  work  suggests  that  there  is  no  need  to  distinguish  between  these  two  stages,  since,  as  we  will show,  divisive normalization comes close to  providing a  maximum  likelihood estimation.  More generally,  we  propose that there may  not  be any  part  of the cortex that acts as  an  ideal observer for  patterns of activity in sensory areas  but, instead, that each cortical layer acts as an ideal observer of the activity in  the  preceding layer."

We  observe  that  the  mapping  from  images  to  statistics  is  many-to-one  and  show  it  can  be  quantified  by  a  phase  space  factor.  This  phase  space approach throws light on the Minimax Entropy technique for  learning Gibbs distributions on images with potentials derived from  image statistics and elucidates the ambiguities that are inherent to  determining the potentials.  In  addition, it shows that if the phase  factor  can  be  approximated  by  an  analytic  distribution  then  this  approximation  yields  a  swift  ""Minutemax""  algorithm  that  vastly  reduces  the  computation  time  for  Minimax entropy  learning.  An  illustration  of this  concept,  using  a  Gaussian  to  approximate  the  phase  factor,  gives  a  good  approximation  to  the  results  of  Zhu  and  Mumford  (1997)  in  just  seconds  of  CPU  time.  The  phase  space  approach  also  gives  insight  into  the  multi-scale  potentials  found  by  Zhu and Mumford  (1997)  and suggests that the forms  of  the potentials are influenced greatly by phase space considerations.

Sontag","We  consider recurrent analog  neural  nets  where each gate is  subject to  Gaussian noise, or any other common noise distribution whose probabil(cid:173) ity density function is nonzero on a large set.  We  show that many regular  languages cannot be  recognized by  networks of this  type,  for  example  the  language  {w  E  {O, I} * I w begins with O},  and  we  give  a  precise  characterization of those languages which can be recognized.

This  definition  suggests  that  to  fmd  texture  we  look  for  outliers  to  the  local  statistics,  and  label  as  texture  the  regions  with  no  outliers.  We  present a  method,  based  upon  this  idea, for  labeling points  in  natural scenes  as  belonging to  texture  regions,  while  simultaneously  allowing  us  to  label  low(cid:173) level,  bottom-up  cues  for  visual  attention.  This  method  is  based  upon  recent  psychophysics  results  on  processing  of texture  and  popout. 
1  WHAT  IS  TEXTURE,  AND  WHY  DO  WE  WANT  TO  FIND  IT? 
In  a  number  of problems  in  computer  VlSlon  and  image  processing,  one  must  distinguish  between  image  regions  that  correspond  to  objects  and  those  which  correspond to  texture,  and  perform different processing depending  upon  the  type  of  region.  Current  computer  vision  algorithms  assume  one  magically  knows  this  region  labeling.  But  what  is  texture?  We  have  the  notion  that texture  involves  a  pattern  that  is  somehow  homogeneous,  or  in  which  signal  changes  are  ""too  complex""  to  describe,  so  that  aggregate  properties  must  be  used  instead  (Saund,  1998).  There is  by no means a firm  division between texture and  objects; rather, the  characterization often depends upon  the scale of interest (Saund, 1998).

An Application to Rotated Digit Recognition,Shumeet Baluja,"This  paper  describes  a  simple  and  efficient  method  to  make  template-based  object classification invariant to in-plane rotations. The task is divided into two  parts:  orientation discrimination and classification. The key idea is  to perform  the  orientation  discrimination  before  the  classification.  This  can  be  accom(cid:173) plished by hypothesizing, in  turn, that the input image belongs to each class of  interest. The image can then be rotated to  maximize its  similarity to the train(cid:173) ing images in each class (these contain the prototype object in an upright orien(cid:173) tation). This process yields a set of images, at least one of which will have the  object  in  an  upright position.  The resulting  images  can  then be classified by  models  which  have been  trained  with  only  upright examples.  This  approach  has  been  successfully  applied  to  two  real-world  vision-based  tasks:  rotated  handwritten digit recognition and rotated face detection in cluttered scenes."

Lewicki, Terrence J. Sejnowski","We  present  an  unsupervised  classification  algorithm  based  on  an  ICA  mixture  model.  The  ICA  mixture  model  assumes  that  the  observed  data can  be  categorized  into  several  mutually  exclusive  data classes  in  which  the components  in each  class  are generated  by  a  linear  mixture  of independent  sources.  The  algorithm  finds  the independent sources, the mixing matrix for  each class and also  computes  the  class  membership  probability  for  each  data  point.  This  approach  extends  the  Gaussian  mixture  model  so  that  the  classes  can  have  non-Gaussian  structure.  We  demonstrate  that  this method can learn efficient codes to represent images of natural  scenes and text.  The learned classes of basis functions yield a better  approximation of the underlying distributions of the data, and thus  can provide greater coding efficiency.  We  believe that this method  is  well  suited to  modeling structure in  high-dimensional  data and  has many potential applications.

Partially  observable  Markov  decision  processes  (POMDPs)  model  decision problems in which an  agent tries to maximize its reward in  the  face  of limited sensor feedback.  Recent work has shown empirically that  a  reinforcement  learning  (RL)  algorithm  called  Sarsa(A)  can  efficiently  find  optimal  memoryless  policies,  which  map  current  observations  to  actions,  for  POMDP  problems  (Loch  and  Singh  1998).  The  Sarsa(A)  algorithm uses a form  of short-term memory  called an eligibility trace,  which  distributes  temporally  delayed  rewards  to  observation-action  pairs  which  lead  up  to  the  reward.  This  paper  explores  the  effect  of  eligibility traces on the ability of the Sarsa(A) algorithm to find  optimal  memoryless  policies.  A  variant  of  Sarsa(A)  called  k-step  truncated  Sarsa(A)  is  applied to four test  problems taken  from  the  recent  work of  Littman,  Littman,  Cassandra  and  Kaelbling,  Parr  and  Russell,  and  Chrisman.  The  empirical  results  show  that  eligibility  traces  can  be  significantly  truncated  without  affecting  the  ability  of Sarsa(A)  to  find  optimal memoryless policies for POMDPs."

Marrs, Andrew R. Webb","Two  developments of nonlinear latent variable models  based  on  radial  basis functions are discussed:  in the first, the use of priors or constraints  on allowable models is considered as a means of preserving data structure  in  low-dimensional representations for  visualisation  purposes.  Also,  a  resampling approach  is  introduced which  makes  more  effective use  of  the latent samples in evaluating the likelihood."

Unique features  of targets enable them  to pop out against the background, while targets defined by lacks of  features or conjunctions of features are more difficult to spot.  It is  known that the ease of target detection can change when the roles  of figure  and  ground  are  switched.  The  mechanisms  underlying  the  ease  of  pop  out  and  asymmetry  in  visual  search  have  been  elusive.  This paper shows that a model of segmentation in VI based  on  intracortical  interactions  can  explain  many  of the  qualitative  aspects of visual search."

A  robust  encoding  method  is  developed  to  meet  CMM  input  requirements .  A  hardware implementation of the CMM is  described, which gives  over 200  times  the  speed  of a  current  mid-range  workstation,  and  is  scaleable  to  very  large  problems.  When  tested  on  several  benchmarks  and  compared  with a simple k-NN method, the CMM classifier gave  less than  I %  lower  accuracy  and  over  4  and  12  times  speed-up  in  software  and  hardware  respectively."

In this paper, we apply LRTA * to the problem of getting to  a given goal location in an initially unknown environment.  Uninformed LRTA * with  maximal  lookahead always moves  on a  shortest path to the closest unvisited  state,  that is, to the closest potential goal state.  This was believed to be a good exploration  heuristic, but we show that it does not minimize the worst-case plan-execution time  compared to other uninformed exploration methods.  This result is also of interest to  reinforcement-learning researchers  since many  reinforcement learning methods use  asynchronous dynamic  programming,  interleave  planning and  plan  execution,  and  exhibit optimism in the face of uncertainty, just like LRTA *."

Kearns, Lawrence K. Saul","We  study  probabilistic  inference  in  large,  layered  Bayesian  net(cid:173) works  represented  as  directed  acyclic  graphs.  We  show  that  the  intractability of exact inference in such  networks does  not preclude  their effective  use.  We  give algorithms for  approximate probabilis(cid:173) tic inference  that exploit averaging phenomena occurring at nodes  with  large  numbers  of parents.  We  show  that  these  algorithms  compute  rigorous  lower  and  upper  bounds  on  marginal probabili(cid:173) ties  of interest,  prove  that these  bounds  become exact in  the limit  of large networks,  and provide rates  of convergence."

Wheeler, Atam P. Dhawan",A  wavelet  basis  selection  procedure  is  presented  for  wavelet  re(cid:173) gression.  Both  the  basis  and  threshold  are  selected  using  cross(cid:173) validation.  The  method  includes  the  capability  of  incorporating  prior knowledge on the smoothness (or shape of the basis functions)  into  the  basis  selection  procedure.  The  results  of the  method  are  demonstrated  using  widely  published  sampled  functions.  The  re(cid:173) sults of the method are contrasted with other basis function  based  methods.

Experimental  data  indicate  that (I) single  neurons  in  these  regions  are  broadly tuned to parameters of movement; (2) appropriate commands are  elaborated by  populations of neurons; (3) the coordinated action of neu(cid:173) rons can be  visualized  using a neuronal population vector (NPV).  How(cid:173) ever,  the  NPV  provides only  a rough  estimate  of movement parameters  (direction, velocity) and may even fail  to reflect the parameters of move(cid:173) ment when arm posture is changed.  We designed a model of the cortical  motor command to  investigate the relation between the desired direction  of the  movement, the  actual direction of movement and  the direction of  the NPV in  motor cortex. The model is a two-layer self-organizing neural  network  which  combines  broadly-tuned  (muscular)  proprioceptive  and  (cartesian) visual information to calculate (angular) motor commands for  the  initial  part  of the  movement of a  two-link  arm.  The  network  was  trained  by  motor babbling  in  5  positions.  Simulations  showed  that  (1)  the  network produced appropriate movement direction over a  large part  of the  workspace;  (2) small  deviations of the  actual  trajectory  from  the  desired  trajectory existed  at the extremities of the  workspace;  (3)  these  deviations were accompanied by  large deviations of the NPV from both  trajectories. These results suggest the NPV does not give a faithful image  of cortical processing during arm reaching movements.
