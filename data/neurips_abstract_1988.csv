Paulin, Mark E. Nelson, James M. Bower","We present a new hypothesis that the cerebellum plays a key role in ac(cid:173) tively controlling the acquisition of sensory infonnation by the nervous  system.  In this paper we explore this idea by examining the function of  a  simple  cerebellar-related  behavior,  the  vestibula-ocular  reflex  or  VOR, in  which  eye movements  are generated to minimize image slip  on  the  retina  during  rapid  head  movements.  Considering  this  system  from  the point of view of statistical estimation theory, our results  sug(cid:173) gest that the transfer function of the VOR, often regarded as a static or  slowly  modifiable  feature  of the  system,  should  actually  be  continu(cid:173) ously and rapidly changed during head movements. We further suggest  that these changes are under the direct control of the cerebellar cortex  and propose experiments to test this hypothesis."

Hopfield","The olfactory  bulb of mammals  aids  in  the  discrimination  of  odors.  A  mathematical  model  based  on  the  bulbar  anatomy  and  electrophysiology  is  described.  Simulations  produce  a  35-60  Hz  modulated activity coherent across the bulb, mimicing the observed  field  potentials.  The  decision  states  (for  the  odor  information)  here  can  be  thought  of as  stable  cycles,  rather  than  point  stable  states  typical  of simpler  neuro-computing  models.  Analysis  and  simulations show that a  group of coupled non-linear oscillators are  responsible for the oscillatory activities determined by the odor in(cid:173) put, and that the bulb, with appropriate inputs from higher centers,  can  enhance  or suppress  the  sensitivity  to  partiCUlar  odors.  The  model provides a framework  in which to understand the transform  between odor input and the bulbar output to olfactory cortex."

Hence,  the  probability of attaining particular energy minima  may be associated  with  the  probabilities  of  making  certain  decisions  (or  classifications).  However,  because of its stochastic  nature,  the complexity of the BM is fairly  high and  therefore  such  networks  are  not  very  likely  to  be  used  in  practice.  In  this  paper  we  suggest  a  way  to  alleviate  this  drawback  by  converting  the  sto(cid:173) chastic  BM into  a  deterministic  network  which  we  call  the  Boltzmann  Per(cid:173) ceptron  Network  (BPN).  The BPN is functionally  equivalent  to  the  BM but  has  a  feed-forward  structure  and  low  complexity.  No annealing  is required.  The  conditions  under  which  such  a  convmion  is  feasible  are  given.  A  learning  algorithm  for  the  BPN based  on  the  conjugate  gradient  method  is  also provided which is somewhat akin  to the backpropagation algorithm."

Bower, Carver Mead","We  have used analog VLSI technology to model a class of small os(cid:173) cillating  biological neural circuits  known  as  central pattern  gener(cid:173) ators  (CPG). These circuits generate rhythmic patterns of activity  which drive locomotor behaviour in the animal.  We  have designed,  fabricated,  and tested a model neuron circuit which relies on many  of the  same  mechanisms  as  a  biological  central pattern  generator  neuron,  such  as  delays  and  internal feedback.  We  show  that  this  neuron can be used  to build several small circuits based on known  biological CPG circuits, and that these circuits produce patterns of  output which  are very similar to the observed biological patterns. 
To  date,  researchers  in  applied  neural  networks  have  tended  to  focus  on  mam(cid:173) malian systems  as  the  primary source  of  potentially  useful  biological  information.  However,  invertebrate systems may represent  a source  of ideas  in many ways  more  appropriate, given current levels of engineering sophistication in building neural-like  systems, and given the state of biological understanding of mammalian circuits.  In(cid:173) vertebrate  systems  are  based  on  orders  of magnitude  smaller  numbers  of neurons  than  are  mammalian  systems.  The  networks  we  will  consider  here,  for  example,  are  composed  of  about  a  dozen  neurons,  which  is  well  within  the  demonstrated  capabilities  of current  hardware  fabrication  techniques.  Furthermore,  since  much  more detailed structural information is  available about these systems than for  most  systems in  higher animals, insights can be guided by real information rather than by  guesswork.  Finally, even though they are constructed of small numbers of neurons,  these networks have  numerous interesting and  potentially even useful properties. 
CENTRAL PATTERN  GENERATORS 
Of  all  the  invertebrate  neural  networks  currently  being  investigated  by  neurobi(cid:173) ologists,  the  class  of  networks  known  as  central  pattern  generators  (CPGs)  may  be  especially  worthy  of attention.  A  CPG is  responsible  for  generating  oscillatory  neural  activity  that  governs  specific  patterns  of  motor  output,  and  can  generate  its  pattern  of activity  when  isolated  from  its  normal neuronal  inputs.  This  prop-

erty, which greatly facilitates experiments, has enabled biologists to describe several  CPGs in  detail at  the cellular and synaptic level.  These networks have  been found  in all animals,  but have been extensively studied in invertebrates [Selverston,  1985]. 
We  chose to model several small CPG networks using analog VLSI technology.  Our  model differs from  most computer simulation models of biological networks [Wilson  and Bower, in press] in that we did not attempt to model the details of the individual  ionic currents,  nor did we  attempt to model each known connection in the networks.  Rather, our aim  was  to determine the basic  functionality  of a  set of CPG networks  by modeling them as  the minimum set of connections required to reproduce output  qualitatively similar to that produced by the real network under certain conditions. 
MODELING  CPG NEURONS 
The  basic  building  block  for  our  model  is  a  general  purpose  CPG  neuron  circuit.  This circuit, shown  in  Figure  1,  is  our model  for  a  typical neuron  found  in central  pattern  generators,  and  contains  some  of  the  essential  elements  of real  biological  neurons.  Like real neurons, this model integrates current and uses positive feedback  to  output  a  train  of pulses,  or  action  potentials,  whose  frequency  depends  on  the  magnitude of the current input.  The part of the circuit which generates these pulses  is  shown  in  Figure 2a [Mead,  19891. 
The second element in  the CPG neuron circuit is the synapse.  In Figure 1,  each pair  of transistors functions as a synapse.  The p-well transistors are. excitatory synapses,  whereas the n-well transistors are inhibitory synapses.  One of the transistors in the  pair sets the strength of the synapse,  while  the other transistor is  the  input of the  synapse.  Each  CPG neuron  has four  different synapses. 
The  third element of our model  CPG neuron  involves  temporal delays.  Delays  are  an essential element in the function of CPGs, and biology has evolved many different  mechanisms  to  introduce delays  into neural networks.  The membrane capacitance  of the  cell  body,  different  rates of chemical reactions,  and  axonal transmission  are  just  a  few  of the  mechanisms which  have  time constants  associated with  them.  In  our  model we  have  included  synaptic  delay  as  the  principle source of delay  in  the  network.  This  is  modeled  as  an  RC  delay,  implemented  by  the follower-integrator  circuit shown in Figure 2b [Mead,  19891.  The time constant of the delay is a function  of the  conductance  of  the  amplifier,  set  by  the  bias  G.  A  multiple  time  constant  delay line is  formed  by cascading several of these elements.  Our neuron circuit uses  a  delay  line  with  three  time  constants.  The  synapses  which  are  before  the  delay  element  are  slow synapses, whereas the  undelayed synapses  are  fa.st  synapses. 
We fabricated the circuit shown in Figure 1 using CMOS, VLSI technology.  Several  of these  circuits  were  put  on  each  chip,  with  all  of  the  inputs  and  controls  going  out  to pads, so  that these  cells  could  be externally connected  to form  the  network  of interest.

Rumelhart (1987). has proposed a method for choosing minimal or  ""simple""  in Back-propagation  networks. This approach can be used to (a) dynamically select the  number of hidden units. (b) construct a representation that is  appropriate for the problem and (c) thus improve the generalization  ability of Back-propagation networks. The method Rumelhart suggests  involves adding penalty terms to the usual error function. In this paper  we introduce Rumelhart·s minimal networks idea and compare two  possible biases on the weight search space. These biases are compared  in both simple counting problems and a speech recognition problem.  In general. the constrained search does seem to minimize the number of  hidden units required with an expected increase in local minima."

Leung, Victor W. Zue","This paper is concerced with the use of error back-propagation  in phonetic classification. Our objective is to investigate the ba(cid:173) sic characteristics of back-propagation, and study how the frame(cid:173) work of multi-layer perceptrons can be exploited in phonetic recog(cid:173) nition. We explore issues such as integration of heterogeneous  sources of information, conditioll~ that can affect performance of  phonetic classification, internal representations, comparisons with  traditional pattern classification techniques, comparisons of differ(cid:173) ent error metrics, and initialization of the network. Our investiga(cid:173) tion is performed within a set of experiments that attempts to rec(cid:173) ognize the 16 vowels in American English independent of speaker.  Our results are comparable to human performance. 
Early approaches in phonetic recognition fall into two major extremes: heuristic  and algorithmic. Both approaches have their own merits and shortcomings. The  heuristic approach has the intuitive appeal that it focuses on the linguistic informa(cid:173) tion in the speech signal and exploits acoustic-phonetic knowledge. HO'fever, the  weak control strategy used for utilizing our knowledge has been grossly inadequate.  At the other extreme, the algorithmic approach relies primarily on the powerful con(cid:173) trol strategy offered by well-formulated pattern recognition techniques. However,  relatively little is known about how our speech knowledge accumulated over the  past few decades can be incorporated into the well-formulated algorithms. We feel  that artificial neural networks (ANN) have some characteristics that can potentially  enable them to bridge the gap between these two extremes. On the one hand, our  speech knowledge can provide guidance to the structure and design of the network.  On the other hand, the self-organizing mechanism of ANN can provide a control  strategy for utilizing our knowledge. 
In this paper, we extend our earlier work on the use of artificial neural networks  for phonetic recognition [2]. Specifically, we focus our investigation on the following  sets of issues. First, we describe the use of the network to integrate heterogeneous  sources of information. We will see how classification performance improves as more

A. Mead","We describe an electronic photoreceptor circuit that is sensitive to  small changes in incident light intensity. The sensitivity to change8  in the intensity is achieved by feeding back to the input a filtered  version of the output. The feedback loop includes a hysteretic el(cid:173) ement. The circuit behaves in a manner reminiscent of the gain  control properties and temporal responses of a variety of retinal  cells, particularly retinal bipolar cells. We compare the thresholds  for detection of intensity increments by a human and by the cir(cid:173) cuit. Both obey Weber's law and for both the temporal contrast  sensitivities are nearly identical. 
We previously described an electronic photoreceptor that outputs a voltage that is  logarithmic in the light intensity (Mead, 1985). This report describes an extension  of this circuit which was based on a suggestion by Frank Werblin that biological  retinas may achieve greater sensitivity to change8 in the illumination by feeding  back a filtered version of the output. 
OPERATION OF THE CIRCUIT 
The circuit (Figure 1) consists of a phototransistor (P), exponential feedback to  P (Ql, Q2, and Q3), a transconductance amplifier (A), and the hysteretic element  (Q4 and Qs). In general terms the operation of the circuit consists of two stages of  amplification with hysteresis in the feedback loop. The light falls on the parasitic  bipolar transistor P. (The rest of the circuit is shielded by metal.) P's collector  is the substrate and the base is an isolated well. P and Ql form the first stage of  amplification. The light produces a base current Is for P. The emitter current IE  is PIs, neglecting collector resistance for now. P is typically a few hundred. The  feedback current IQl is set by the gate voltage on QdQ2' which is set by the current  through Q3, which is set by the feedback voltage Vjb. In equilibrium Vjb will be  such that IQl = IE and some voltage Vp will be the output of the first stage. The

The DC output of the circuit will be Vout ~ V/b = Vdd - (2kT /q) log IE, neglecting  the back-gate effect for Q2. Figure Sa (DC output) shows that the assumption of  subthreshold operation is valid over about 4 orders of magnitude."

1  Adaptive  Networks 
Much  of the  recent  excitement  about  neural  network  models  of computation  has  been  driven  by  the  prospect  of new  architectures  for  fine  grained  parallel  compu(cid:173) tation using analog VLSI.  Adaptive systems are espescially good targets for  analog  VLSI because the ada.ptive process  can compensate for  the inaccuracy of individual  devices  as easily as for  the variability of the signal.  However, silicon  VLSI  does  not  provide  us  with  an  ideal solution  for  weight  storage.  Among  the  properties  of an  ideal storage technology for  analog VLSI  adaptive systems  are: 
•  The minimum available weight change ~w must be small.  The simplest adap(cid:173)
tive  algorithms optimize  the  weights  by  minimizing  the  output  error  with  a  steepest  descent  search  in weight space  [1].  Iterative improvement algorithms  such  as  steepest  descent  are  based  on  the  heuristic  assumption  of  'better'  weights being found  in  the neighborhood of 'good' ones;  a  heuristic that fails  when  the granularity of the weights is  not fine  enough.  In the worst  case,  the  resolution required just to represent  a  function  can  grow exponentially in  the  dimension of the input space . 
•  The  weights  must be able  to represent  both  positive and negative values  and  the  changes  must  be easily  reversible.  Frequently,  the  weights  may cycle  up  and down while the adaptive process is converging and millions of incremental  changes  during  a  single  training session  is  not  unreasonable.  If the  weights  cannot easily  follow  all  of these  changes,  then  the  learning  must  be  done  off  chip.

ROUGH SKETCH OF OUR THEORY 
In order to describe the use-dependent self-organization of neural connections  {Singer,1987 and Frank,1987},  we  have  proposed  a  set of coupled  equations  involving  the  electrical  activities  and  neural  connection  density  {Tanaka,  1988}, by using the following physiologically based hypotheses: (1) Modifiable  synapses grow or collapse due to  the competition among themselves for  some  trophic factors,  which are secreted retrogradely from  the postsynaptic side to  the  presynaptic  side.  (2)  Synapses  also  sprout or  retract  according  to  the  concurrence  of presynaptic  spike  activity  and  postsynaptic  local  membrane  depolarization.  (3)  There already exist lateral connections within the  layer,  into  which  the  modifiable  nerve  fibers  are  destined  to  project,  before  the  synaptic modification begins.  Considering this set of equations, we  find  that  the  time  scale  of electrical  activities  is  much  smaller  than  time  course  necessary  for  synapses  to  grow  or  retract.  So  we  can  apply  the  adiabatic  approximation to the equations.  Furthermore, we identify the input electrical  activities,  i.e.,  the  firing  frequency  elicited  from  neurons  in  the  projecting  neuronal layer, with the stochastic process which is specialized by the spatial  correlation function  Ckp;k'  p'.  Here,  k  and  k'  represent  the  positions  of the  neurons  in  the  projecting  layer.  II  stands  for  different  pathways  such  as  ipsilateral  or  contralateral,  on-center  or  off-center,  colour  specific  or  nonspecific  and  so  on.

I  - INTRODUCTION 
The Winner-Take-All  Network  is  a  network  which  identifies  the  largest  of N  real  numbers.  Winner-Take-All  Networks  have  been  developed  using  various  neural  networks models (Grossberg-73, Lippman-87, Feldman-82, Lazzaro-89).  We present  here  a  generalization  of the  Winner-Take-All  Network:  the  K-Winners-Take-All  (KWTA) Network.  The KWTA Network identifies the K  largest of N  real numbers.  The neural network model we  use throughout the paper is  the continuous Hopfield  network  model  (Hopfield-84).  If the states of the  N  nodes are initialized  to the N  real numbers, then, if the gain of the sigmoid is large enough, the network converges  to the state with  K  positive real numbers in  the positions of the nodes with  the K  largest  initial states, and  N  - K  negative  real  numbers everywhere else.  Consider  the  following  example:  N  = 4,  K  = 2.  There  are  6  =  (~)  stable  states:(++-)T, (++)T, (+--+)T, ( _ ++)T, (++)T, and (++)T.  If the initial  state of the  network  is  (0.3,  -0.4,  0.7,  O.l)T,  then  the network  will  converge to (Vi,V2,V3,v4)T  where Vi> 0,  V2  < 0,  V3  > 0,  V4  < 0  ((+ _ +_)T).  In Section II, we  define  the KWTA  Network (connection weights, external inputs).  In Section III,  we  analyze  the equilibrium states and  in  Section  IV,  we  identify  all  the stable equilibrium states of the KWTA Network.  In Section V, we  describe the  dynamics  of the  KWTA  Network.  In  Section  VI,  we  give  two  important examples  of the KWTA  Network and comment on an alternate implementation of the KWTA  Network.

II - THE K-WINNERS-TAKE-ALL  NETWORK 
The continuous Hopfield network model (Hopfield-84)  (also known as the Grossberg  additive model  (Grossberg-88)), is characterized by a system of first order differen(cid:173) tial equations which governs the evolution of the state of the network (i = 1, .. . , N) : 
The  sigmoid  function  g(u)  is  defined  by:  g(u)  = f(G·  u),  where  G  >  0  is  the  gain  of  the  sigmoid,  and  f(u)  is  defined  by:  1.  ""f/u,  0  <  f'(u)  <  f'(O)  = 1,  2.  limu .... +oo  f( u) = 1,  3.  limu .... -oo f( u) = -l.  The KWTA Network is characterized by mutually inhibitory interconnections Taj  =  -1  for  i  ¥=  j, a self connection Tai  = a,  (Ial < 1) and'an external input (identical  for  every node) which  depends on the number  K  of winners desired and the size of  the network  N  : ti = 2K - N.  The differential equations for  the KWTA  Network are therefore: 
for  all  i,  Cd~i = -Aui + (a + l)g(ui) - (tg(u j )  - t) ,"

R. Walker, S. Haghighi, A. Afghan, Larry A. Akers","Hardware implementation of neuromorphic algorithms is hampered by  high  degrees of connectivity.  Functionally equivalent feedforward  networks may be formed by using limited fan-in nodes and additional  layers.  but  this  complicates  procedures  for  determining  weight  magnitudes.  No direct mapping of weights exists between fully and  limited-interconnect  nets.  Low-level  nonlinearities  prevent  the  formation  of internal  representations  of widely  separated  spatial  features and the use of gradient descent methods to minimize output  error is hampered by error magnitude dissipation.  The judicious use  of linear summations or collection units is proposed as a solution. 
HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF FEEDFORWARD, 
SYNTHETIC NEURAL SYSTEMS 
The pursuit of hardware implementations of artificial neural network models is motivated  by the need to develop  systems which are capable of executing neuromorphic algorithms  in  real  time.  The most significant barrier is  the  high  degree  of connectivity  required  between the processing elements.  Current interconnect technology does not support the  direct  implementation  of  large-scale  arrays  of  this  type.  In  particular.  the  high  fan-in/fan-outs  of biology  impose  connectivity  requirements  such  that  the  electronic  implementation  of a  highly  interconnected biological  neural  networks  of just a  few  thousand neurons would require a level of connectivity which exceeds the current or even  projected interconnection density ofULSI systems (Akers et al.  1988). 
Highly layered. limited-interconnected architectures are however. especially well suited for  VLSI  implementations.  In  previous  works.  we  analyzed  the  generalization  and  fault-tolerance characteristics of a limited-interconnect perceptron architecture applied in  three simple mappings between binary input space and binary output space and proposed a  CMOS architecture (Akers and Walker. 1988).  This paper concentrates on developing an  understanding  of the limitations on  layered  neural  network  architectures  imposed by  hardware implementation and a proposed solution.

TRAINING CONSIDERATIONS FOR 
LIMITED .. INTERCONNECT FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS 
The symbolic layout of the limited fan-in  network is shown in Fig.  1.  Re-arranging of  the individual input components is done to eliminate edge effects.  Greater detail on the  actual  hardware architecture may be found  in  (Akers and Walker,  1988)  As  in  linear  filters,  the  total  number  of connections  which  fan-in  to  a  given  processing  element  determines the degrees of freedom available for forming a hypersurface which implements  the desired node output function (Widrow and Stearns, 1985).  When processing elements  with fixed, low fan-in are employed, the affects of reduced  degrees of freedom  must be  considered in order to develop workable training methods which permit generalization of  novel  inputs.  First. no  direct or indirect relation  exists  between  weight  magnitudes  obtained for a limited-interconnect, multilayered perceptron, and those obtained for  the  fully connected case.  Networks of these types adapted with identical exemplar sets must  therefore fonn  completely different functions  on  the input  space.  Second,  low-level  nonlinearities prevent direct internal  coding of widely  separated spatial features  in  the  input set.  A related problem  arises  when hyperplane nonlinearities are used.  Multiple  hyperplanes required on a subset of input space are impossible when no two second level  nodes  address  identical positions  in  the  input  space.  Finally,  adaptation  methods  like  backpropagation which minimize output error with gradient descent are hindered since the  magnitude of the error is dissipated as it back-propagates through large numbers of hidden  layers.  The appropriate placement of linear summation elements or collection  units is a  proposed solution."

The network uses the  pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t-l,  together with element t, to predict element t+ 1. When the network is  trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn  to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. Cluster analyses  of the hidden-layer patterns of activation showed that they encode  prediction-relevant information about the entire path traversed through  the network. We illustrate the phases of learning with cluster analyses  performed at different points during training. 
Several connectionist architectures that are explicitly constrained to capture  sequential infonnation have been developed. Examples are Time Delay  Networks (e.g. Sejnowski & Rosenberg. 1986) -- also called 'moving  window' paradigms -- or algorithms such as back-propagation in time  (Rumelhart.

THE WINNER-TAKE-ALL CmCUIT 
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the winner-take-all circuit. A single wire, asso(cid:173) ciated with the potential Vc, computes the inhibition for the entire circuit; for an  n neuron circuit, this wire is O(n) long. To compute the global inhibition, each  neuron k contributes a current onto this common wire, using transistor T2 a.' To  apply this global inhibition locally, each neuron responds to the common wire volt(cid:173) age Vc, using transistor Tla.' This computation is continuous in time; no clocks  are used. The circuit exhibits no hysteresis, and operates with a time constant  related to the size of the largest input. The output representation of the circuit  is not binary; the winning output encodes the logarithm of its associated input. 
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the winner-take-all circuit. Each neuron receives  a unidirectional current input 11;; the output voltages VI •.. VB represent the result  of the winner-take-all computation. If II; = max(II ••• IB ), then VI; is a logarithmic  function of 11;; if Ii <: 11;, then Vi ~ O. 
A static and dynamic ana.lysis of the two-neuron circuit illustrates these system  properties. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of a two-neuron winner-take-all  circuit. To understand the beha.vior of the circuit, we first consider the input  condition II = 12 = 1m. Transistors TIl ~d T12 have identical potentials at gate  and source, and are both sinking 1m; thus, the drain potentials VI and V2 must be  equal. Transistors T21 and T22 have identical source, drain, and gate potentials,  and therefore must sink the identical current ICI = IC2 = Ic/2. In the subthreshold  region of operation, the equation 1m = 10 exp(Vc/Vo) describes transistors Til and  T12 , where 10 is a fabrication parameter, and Vo = kT/qlt. Likewise, the equation  Ic/2 = 10 exp((Vm - Vel/Volt where Vm = VI = V2, describes transistors T21 and  T22 . Solving for Vm(Im, Ie) yields 
Vm = Voln(~:) + Voln(:;)."

Baird, Isabelle Guyon","This paper describes the construction of a system that recognizes hand-printed  digits, using a combination of classical techniques and neural-net methods. The  system has been trained and tested on real-world data, derived from zip codes seen  on actual U.S. Mail. The system rejects a small percentage of the examples as  unclassifiable, and achieves a very low error rate on the remaining examples. The  system compares favorably with other state-of-the art recognizers.

In this paper we consider its utility  as a spurious-free content-addressable memory, and provide bounds on  its performance in this context. We show how to exploit the machine's  ability to escape local minima, in order to use it, at a constant  temperature, for unambiguous associative pattern-retrieval in noisy  environments. An association rule, which creates a sphere of influence  around each stored pattern, is used along with the Machine's dynamics  to match the machine's noisy input with one of the pre-stored patterns.  Spurious fIxed points, whose regions of attraction are not recognized by  the rule, are skipped, due to the Machine's fInite probability to escape  from any state. The results apply to the Boltzmann machine and to the  asynchronous net of binary threshold elements (Hopfield model'). They  provide the network designer with worst-case and best-case bounds for  the network's performance, and allow polynomial-time tradeoff studies  of design parameters."

The  network  consists  of two  levels  which  are  coupled  through feedfoward and shunted feedback connections. The lower level  is  a  two-dimensional  diffusion map which  accepts  visual  features  as  input, and spreads activity over larger scales as a function of time. The  upper layer is periodically fed the  activity from  the diffusion layer and  locates local maxima in it (an extreme form  of contrast enhancement)  using a network of local comparators. These local maxima are fed back  to  the  diffusion  layer  using  an  on-center/off-surround  shunting  anatomy. The maxima are also available  as output of the network.

This paper extends  the concept of simulated annealing from its original formulation  as a Markov process to a new formulation based on mean field  theory. Mean field annealing essentially replaces the discrete de(cid:173) grees of freedom in simulated annealing with their average values  as computed by the mean field approximation. The net result is  that equilibrium at a given temperature is achieved 1-2 orders of  magnitude faster than with simulated annealing.

STOCHASTIC VERSUS MEAN FIELD 
In combinatorial optimization problems, an objective function or Hamiltonian,  H(s), is presented which depends on a vector of interacting 3pim, S = {81,"" .,8N},  in some complex nonlinear way. Stochastic simulated annealing (SSA) (S. Kirk(cid:173) patrick, C. Gelatt, and M. Vecchi (1983)) finds a global minimum of H by com(cid:173) bining gradient descent with a random process. This combination allows, under  certain conditions, choices of s which actually increa3e H, thus providing SSA with  a mechanism for escaping from local minima. The frequency and severity of these  uphill moves is reduced by slowly decreasing a parameter T (often referred to as  the temperature) such that the system settles into a global optimum. 
Two conceptual operationo; are involved in simulated annealing: a thermodatic op(cid:173) eration which schedules decreases in the temperature, and a relazation operation

Several models for the role  of processing noise are analyzed, and the biological motivation for  considering them is described.

Stanton, Terrence J. Sejnowski","In modeling studies or memory based on neural networks, both the selective  enhancement and depression or synaptic strengths are required ror effident storage  or inrormation (Sejnowski, 1977a,b; Kohonen, 1984; Bienenstock et aI, 1982;  Sejnowski and Tesauro, 1989). We have tested this assumption in the hippocampus,  a cortical structure or the brain that is involved in long-term memory. A brier,  high-frequency activation or excitatory synapses in the hippocampus produces an  increase in synaptic strength known as long-term potentiation, or L TP (BUss and  Lomo, 1973), that can last ror many days. LTP is known to be Hebbian since it  requires the simultaneous release or neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals  coupled with postsynaptic depolarization (Kelso et al, 1986; Malinow and Miller,  1986; Gustatrson et al, 1987). However, a mechanism ror the persistent reduction or  synaptic strength that could balance LTP has not yet been demonstrated. We stu(cid:173) died the associative interactions between separate inputs onto the same dendritic  trees or hippocampal pyramidal cells or field CAl, and round that a low-frequency  input which, by itselr, does not persistently change synaptic strength, can either  increase (associative L TP) or decrease in strength (associative long-term depression  or LTD) depending upon whether it is positively or negatively correlated in time  with a second, high-frequency bursting input. LTP or synaptic strength is Hebbian,  and LTD is anti-Hebbian since it is elicited by pairing presynaptic firing with post(cid:173) synaptic hyperpolarization sufficient to block postsynaptic activity. Thus, associa(cid:173) tive L TP and associative L TO are capable or storing inrormation contained in the  covariance between separate, converging hippocampal inputs •

Simard, Mary B. Ottaway, Dana H. Ballard","This paper provides a systematic analysis of the recurrent backpropaga(cid:173) tion (RBP) algorithm, introducing a number of new results. The main  limitation of the RBP algorithm is that it assumes the convergence of  the network to a stable fixed point in order to backpropagate the error  signals. We show by experiment and eigenvalue analysis that this condi(cid:173) tion can be violated and that chaotic behavior can be avoided. Next we  examine the advantages of RBP over the standard backpropagation al(cid:173) gorithm. RBP is shown to build stable fixed points corresponding to the  input patterns. This makes it an appropriate tool for content address(cid:173) able memories, one-to-many function learning, and inverse problems."
