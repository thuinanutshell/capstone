Although  proven  successful  for  modeling  time  invariant nonlinear systems,  the  inability  of neural  networks  to  characterize  temporal  variability  has  so  far  been  an  obstacle  in  applying  them  to  complicated  non stationary  signals,  such  as  speech.  In  this  paper  we  present  a  network  architecture,  called  ""Hidden  Control  Neural  Network""  (HCNN),  for  modeling  signals  generated  by  nonlinear  dynamical  systems  with  restricted  time  variability.  The approach  taken  here  is  to  allow  the  mapping  that  is  implemented  by  a  multi  layered  neural  network  to  change  with  time  as  a  function  of an  additional  control  input  signal.  This  network  is  trained  using  an  algorithm  that  is  based  on  ""back-propagation""  and  segmentation  algorithms  for  estimating  the  unknown  control  together  with  the  network's  parameters.  The HCNN  approach  was  applied  to  several  tasks  including  modeling  of  time-varying  nonlinear  systems  and  speaker-independent  recognition  of  connected  digits,  yielding  a  word accuracy of 99.1 %."

Chang, Richard P Lippmann","Genetic  algorithms  were  used  to select  and  create  features  and  to select  reference  exemplar  patterns for  machine vision  and speech  pattern  classi(cid:173) fication  tasks.  For a  complex speech  recognition  task,  genetic  algorithms  required no more computation time than traditional approaches to feature  selection  but reduced  the number of input features  required  by a factor  of  five  (from 153 to 33 features).  On a difficult artificial machine-vision task,  genetic  algorithms were  able  to create  new features  (polynomial functions  of the original features)  which reduced  classification error rates from  19%  to  almost  0%.  Neural  net  and  k  nearest  neighbor  (KNN)  classifiers  were  unable to provide such low error rates using only the original features.  Ge(cid:173) netic algorithms were also used to reduce the number of reference exemplar  patterns for  a  KNN classifier.  On a  338 training pattern vowel-recognition  problem with  10  classes,  genetic  algorithms reduced  the number of stored  exemplars from 338 to 43 without significantly increasing classification er(cid:173) ror  rate.  In  all  applications,  genetic  algorithms  were  easy  to  apply  and  found  good  solutions  in  many fewer  trials  than would  be  required  by ex(cid:173) haustive search.  Run times were long, but not unreasonable.  These results  suggest  that genetic  algorithms  are  becoming practical for  pattern  classi(cid:173) fication  problems  as faster  serial  and  parallel computers  are  developed."

The analysis  predicts  that generalization error dynamics  are very dependent  on  a  pri(cid:173) ori initial weights.  In particular, the generalization error might sometimes  weave within a computable range during extended training.  In some cases,  the analysis provides bounds on the optimal number of training cycles  for  minimal  validation error.  For a  speech  labeling  task,  predicted  weaving  effects  were qualitatively tested  and  observed  by computer simulations in  networks trained by the linear and non-linear back-propagation algorithm."

These  systems  undergo  a  Hopf bifurcation  from  a  stable  fixed  point  to  a  sta(cid:173) ble  limit  cycle  oscillation  as  certain  parameters  are  varied.  It is  shown  that  their  frequency  of oscillation  is  robust  to  parameter  variations  and  noisy  fluctuations,  a  property that  makes  these  systems  good  candidates  for  pacemakers.  The  onset  of oscillation  is  postponed  by  both  additive  and parametric noise in the sense that the state variable spends more time  near the fixed  point than it would  in  the absence of noise.  This is  also the  case  when  noise  affects  the  delayed  variable,  i.e.  when  the  system  has  a  faulty  memory.  Finally,  it  is  shown  that  a  distribution  of delays  (rather  than a  fixed  delay)  also  stabilizes  the fixed  point solution."

Allen, Anthony Jayakumar, Torsten Zeppenfeld, Ronny Meir",Feedback  connections  are  required  so  that  the  teacher  signal  on  the  output  neurons  can  modify  weights  during  supervised  learning.  Relaxation  methods  are  needed  for  learning  static  patterns  with  full-time  feedback  connections.  Feedback  network  learning  techniques  have  not  achieved  wide  popularity  because  of the  still greater  computational efficiency  of back-propagation.  We  show by simulation that relaxation networks of the kind we  are implementing in  VLSI  are  capable  of  learning  large  problems  just  like  back-propagation  networks.  A microchip incorporates deterministic mean-field theory learning as  well  as  stochastic  Boltzmann  learning.  A  multiple-chip  electronic  system  implementing  these  networks  will  make  high-speed  parallel  learning  in  them  feasible in the future.

Rossen,"We describe a closed-form technique for mapping the output of a trained  backpropagation network int.o input activity space. The mapping is an in(cid:173) verse mapping in the sense that, when the image of the mapping in input  activity space is propagat.ed forward through the normal network dynam(cid:173) ics, it reproduces the output used to generate that image. When more  than one such inverse mappings exist, our inverse ma.pping is special in  that it has no projection onto the nullspace of the activation flow opera(cid:173) tor for the entire network. An important by-product of our calculation,  when more than one invel'se mappings exist, is an orthogonal basis set of  a significant portion of the activation flow operator nullspace. This basis  set can be used to obtain an alternate inverse mapping that is optimized  for a particular rea.l-world application."

Neural networks are most often considered for application in emerging new tech(cid:173) nologies, such as speech recognition, machine vision, and robotics. The fundamental  ideas behind these technologies are still being developed, and it will be some time  before products containing neural networks are manufactured.

In contrast, neural networks are rarely considered for application in mature tech(cid:173) nologies, such as consumer electronics. These technologies are based on established  principles of information processing and communication, and they are used in mil(cid:173) lions of products per year.

We describe in this paper a network that performs grouping of image con(cid:173) tours. The input to the net are fragments of image contours, and the  output is the partitioning of the fragments into groups, together with a  saliency measure for each group. The grouping is based on a measure of  overall length and curvature. The network decomposes the overall opti(cid:173) mization problem into independent optimal pairing problems performed  at each node. The resulting computation maps into a uniform locally  connected network of simple computing elements. 
1 The Problenl: Contour Grouping 
A problem that often arises in visual information processing is the linking of con(cid:173) tour fragments into optimal groups. For example, certain subsets of contours spon(cid:173) taneously form perceptual groups, as illustrated in Fig. 1, and are often detected  immediately without scanning the image in a systematic manner. Grouping process  of this type are likely to play an important role in object recognition by segmenting  the image and selecting image structures that are likely to correspond to objects of  interest in the scene. 
'Ve propose that some form of autonomous grouping is performed at an early stage  based on geometrical characteristics, that are independent of the identity of objects  to be selected. The grouping process is governed by the notion of saliency in a way  that priority is given to forming salient groups at the expense of potentially less  salient ones. This general notion can again be illustrated by Fig. 1; it appears that  certain groups spontaneously emerge, while grouping decisions concerning the less  salient parts of the image may remain unresolved. As we shall see, the computation  below exhibits a similar behavior. 
We define a grouping of the image contours as the formation of a set of disjoint"

First,  a  highly  redundant  corpus  with  a  restricted  vocabulary was  generated and the network was trained with a limited number of  phonemic variations for the words  in the corpus.  Tests of network performance  on a transfer set yielded a very low error rate.  In a second study, a network was  trained  to  identify  words  from  expert  transcriptions  of speech.  On a  transfer  test,  error  rate  for  correct  simultaneous  identification  of  words  and  word  boundaries was  18%.  The third study used the output of a phoneme classifier as  the input to the word and  word boundary identification network.  The error rate  on a transfer test set was 49% for this task.  Overall, these studies provide a first  step at identifying words in connected discourse with a neural network."

A  small  weight  adjustment  causes  a  ""bifurcation""  in  the  limit  behavior of the network.

Second,  a  study of the  automata resulting  from  the  acquisition  of previously published  languages  indicates  that  while  the architecture  is  NOT  guaranteed  to  find  a  minimal  finite  automata  consistent  with  the  given  exemplars,  which  is  an  NP-Hard  problem,  the  architecture  does  appear capable  of generating  non(cid:173) regular languages by exploiting fractal and chaotic dynamics.

The complexity of the function computed is therefore  increased,  and generalization is degraded.  We analyze replicated networks,  in  which  a  number of identical networks are independently trained on  the  same data and their results averaged.

INTRODUCTION: WHY ARE STATIC AND MOTION  BOUNDARY CONTOUR SYSTEMS  NEEDED? 
Some regions,  notably  MT,  of visual  cortex  are  specialized  for  motion processing.  However, even the earliest stages of visual cortex processing,  such as simple cells in  VI, require stimuli that change through  time for  their  maximal activation and  are  direction-sensitive.  Why has  evolution generated  regions  such  as  MT,  when  even  VI  is  change-sensitive and  direction-sensitive?  What computational properties  are  achieved by MT that are not already available in  VI?"

INTRODUCTION: THE K-WINNER-TAKE-ALL  NETWORK 
We have previously demonstrated the use of a continuous Hopfield neural network  as a K-Winner-Take-All (KWTA) network [Majani et al., 1989, Erlanson and Abu(cid:173) Mostafa, 1988}. Given an input of N real numbers, such a network will converge  to a vector of K positive one components and (N - K) negative one components,  with the positive positions indicating the K largest input components. In addition,  we have shown that the (~) such vectors are the only stable states of the system.  One application of the KWTA network is the analog decoding of error-correcting  codes [Majani et al., 1989, Platt and Hopfield, 1986]. Here, a known set of vectors  (the codewords) are transmitted over a noisy channel. At the receiver's end of the  channel, the initial vector must be reconstructed from the noisy vector.

Finally,  there  might exist  spurious fixed  points and/or  spurious  ""attracting""  trajectories that do  not correspond  to any patterns.  In this paper,  we  introduce a  new  energy  function  that  presents solutions  to all of these problems.  We present an efficient gradient descent algorithm  which directly acts on the stability of the fixed  points and trajectories and  on the size  and shape of the  corresponding basin and valley of attraction.  The results are illustrated by the simulation of a small content addressable  memory."

The circuit effectively  has  512 knots space on  a  uniform grid and  has full support for  learning.  The circuit  also can be used  to approximate  multi-variable functions as sum of splines. 
An  interesting,  and  as  of yet,  nearly  untapped set of applications for  VLSI  imple(cid:173) mentation of neural network learning systems can be found in adaptive control and  non-linear signal processing.  In  most such  applications,  the  learning  task  consists  of approximating a  real  function  of a  small number  of continuous  variables  from  discrete  data points.  Special purpose hardware is especially  interesting for  applica(cid:173) tions of this  type since  they  generally  require  real  time on-line learning  and  there  can  be stiff constraints on  the power  budget and size  of the hardware.  Frequently,  the already difficult  learning problem is made more complex by the non-stationary  nature of the underlying process.  Conventional feed-forward  networks  with sigmoidal units are clearly  inappropriate  for applications of this type.  Although they have exhibited remarkable performance  in some types of time series  prediction  problems (for example, Wiegend,  1990  and  Atlas, 1990), their learning rates in general are too slow for on-line learning.  On-line  performance can be improved most easily by using networks with more constrained  architecture, effectively making the learning problem easier by giving the network a  hint about the learning task.  Networks that build local representations of the data,  such  as  radial  basis  functions,  are excellent  candidates for  these  type of problems.

1 Speculations on Neural Network Pattern Classifiers 
The goal is to provide rapid, reliable classification of new inputs from a  (1)  pattern source. Neural networks are appropriate as pattern classifiers when the  pattern sources are ones of which we have little understanding, beyond perhaps a  nonparametric statistical model, but we have been provided with classified samples  of features drawn from each of the pattern categories. Neural networks should be  able to provide rapid and reliable computation of complex decision functions. The  issue in doubt is their statistical response to new inputs. 
(2) The pursuit of optimality is misguided in the context of Point (1). Indeed, it  is unclear what might be meant by 'optimality' in the absence of a more detailed  mathematical framework for the pattern source. 
(3) The well-known, oft-cited 'curse of dimensionality' exposed by Richard Bell(cid:173) man may be a 'blessing' to neural networks. Individual network processing nodes  (e.g., linear threshold units) become more powerful as the number of their inputs  increases. For a large enough number n of points in an input space of d dimensions,  the number of dichotomies that can be generated by such a node grows exponen(cid:173) tially in d. This suggests that, unlike all previous efforts at pattern classification  that required substantial effort directed at the selection of low-dimensional feature  vectors so as to make the decision rule calculable, we may now be approaching a"

In this work I describe how a qualitative shape  representation, based on the sign of the Gaussian curvature, can be com(cid:173) puted directly from motion disparities, without the computation of an  exact depth map or the directions of surface normals. I show that humans  can judge the curvature sense of three points undergoing 3D motion from  two, three and four views with success rate significantly above chance. A  simple RBF net has been trained to perform the same task."

Sereno, Margaret E. Sereno","Previous work (M.I. Sereno, 1989; cf. M.E. Sereno, 1987) showed that a  feedforward network with area VI-like input-layer units and a Hebb rule  can develop area MT-like second layer units that solve the aperture  problem for pattern motion. The present study extends this earlier work  to more complex motions. Saito et al. (1986) showed that neurons with  large receptive fields in macaque visual area MST are sensitive to  different senses of rotation and dilation, irrespective of the receptive field  location of the movement singularity. A network with an MT-like  second layer was trained and tested on combinations of rotating, dilating,  and translating patterns. Third-layer units learn to detect specific senses  of rotation or dilation in a position-independent fashion, despite having  position-dependent direction selectivity within their receptive fields."

Two neural  network (radial basis function and high order polynomial GMDH network)  and five conventional classifiers (Gaussian mixture, linear tree, K nearest  neighbor, KD-tree, and condensed K nearest neighbor) were evaluated.  Classifiers were chosen to be representative of different approaches to pat(cid:173) tern classification and to complement and extend those evaluated in a  previous study (Lee and Lippmann, 1989). This and the previous study  both demonstrate that classification error rates can be equivalent across  different classifiers when they are powerful enough to form minimum er(cid:173) ror decision regions, when they are properly tuned, and when sufficient  training data is available. Practical characteristics such as training time,  classification time, and memory requirements, however, can differ by or(cid:173) ders of magnitude. These results suggest that the selection of a classifier  for a particular task should be guided not so much by small differences in  error rate, but by practical considerations concerning memory usage, com(cid:173) putational resources, ease of implementation, and restrictions on training  and classification times."

INTRODUCTION - ANALOG  WEIGHTING 
The recent surge of interest in neural networks and parallel analog computation has  motivated  the  need  for  compact  analog computing blocks.  Analog  weighting is  an  important computational function  of this class.  Analog  weighting is  the combining  of two analog values, one  of which  is  typically varying (the input) and one of which  is  typically fixed  (the  weight)  or  at  least  varying  more  slowly.  The  varying  value  is  ""weighted""  by  the  fixed  value  through  the  ""weighting function"",  typically  mul(cid:173) tiplication.  Analog  weighting is  most  interesting  when  the  overall computational  task  involves  computing  the  ""weighted  sum  of the  inputs.""  That  is,  to  compute

Zemel, Geoffrey E.

Each  half of  the  network  ""sees""  one  fragment  of  the object, and  tries to produce  as  output a set of 4 parameters that have  high mutual information with the 4 parameters output by  the other half of  the network.  Given the ensemble of training patterns, the 4 parameters on  which the two halves of the network can agree are the position, orientation,  and  size  of the  whole  object,  or  some  recoding  of them.  After  training,  the network can reject  instances of other shapes by  using the fact  that the  predictions  made  by  its  two  halves  disagree.  If two  competing  networks  are trained on  an unlabelled mixture of images of two objects, they  cluster  the training cases on the basis of the objects' shapes,  independently of the  position, orientation, and size."

We indeed find that, in some cases, the average  generalization is significantly better than the VC bound: the approach to  perfect performance is exponential in the number of examples m, rather  than the 11m result of the bound. In other cases, we do find the 11m  behavior of the VC bound, and in these cases, the numerical prefactor is  closely related to prefactor contained in the bound."

I present a simple extension to the algo(cid:173) rithm that allows it to construct discrete, distributed representations. Discrete  representations are useful because they are relatively easy to analyze and  their information content can readily be measured. Distributed representa(cid:173) tions are useful because they explicitly encode similarity. The basic idea is  to apply competitive learning iteratively to an input pattern, and after each  stage to subtract from the input pattern the component that was captured in  the representation at that stage. This component is simply the weight vector  of the winning unit of the competitive pool. The subtraction procedure forces  competitive pools at different stages to encode different aspects of the input.  The algorithm is essentially the same as a traditional data compression tech(cid:173) nique known as multistep vector quantization, although the neural net per(cid:173) spective suggests potentially powerful extensions to that approach."

Taichi Wang, Bimal Mathur, Christof Koch","We  demonstrate  a  multiscale  adaptive  network  model  of motion  computation in primate area MT. The model consists of two stages:  (l)  local velocities are measured across multiple spatio-temporal channels,  and (2) the optical flow  field  is computed by a  network of direction(cid:173) selective neurons  at multiple  spatial  resolutions.  This model  embeds  the computational efficiency of Multigrid algorithms within a parallel  network as well as adaptively  computes  the most reliable estimate of  the flow  field across different spatial scales. Our model neurons show  the same nonclassical receptive field properties as Allman's type I MT  neurons.  Since local velocities are measured across multiple channels,  various  channels  often  provide  conflicting  measurements  to  the  network. We have incorporated a  veto scheme for conflict resolution.  This mechanism provides a novel explanation for the spatial frequency  dependency of the psychophysical phenomenon called Motion Capture. 
1  MOTIVATION  We previously developed a two-stage model of motion computation in the visual system  of primates  (Le.  magnocellular pathway from  retina to  V1  and  MT;  Wang,  Mathur &  Koch, 1989). This algorithm has these deficiencies:  (1) the issue of optimal spatial scale  for  velocity measurement, and (2)  the issue optimal spatial scale for  the smoothness of  motion field.  To address these deficiencies, we have implemented a multi-scale motion  network based on multigrid algorithms.  All  methods of estimating optical flow  make a basic assumption about the scale of the  velocity relative to the  spatial  neighborhood and to the  temporal  discretization step of  delay. Thus,  if the velocity of the pattern  is much larger than  the ratio of the spatial to  temporal  sampling step, an incorrect velocity  value will be obtained (Battiti, Amaldi  &  Koch,  1991).

We derive from Shepard's  (1987) generalization theory a particular multi-layer network with dynamic  (centers and radii) spherical regions which possesses a specific mass function  (Cauchy). This learning model generalizes the configural-cue network model  (Gluck & Bower 1988): (1) configural cues can be learned and do not require  pre-wiring the power-set of cues, (2) Consequential regions are continuous  rather than discrete and (3) Competition amoungst receptive fields is shown  to be increased by the global extent of a particular mass function (Cauchy).  We compare other common mass functions (Gaussian; used in models of  Moody & Darken; 1989, Krushke, 1990) or just standard backpropogation  networks with hyperplane/logistic hidden units showing that neither fare as  well as models of human generalization and learning. 
1 The Generalization Problem 
Given a favorable or unfavorable consequence, what should an organism assume about  the contingent stimuli? If a moving shadow overhead appears prior to a hawk attack  what should an organism assume about other moving shadows, their shapes and  positions? If a dense food patch is occasioned by a particular density of certain kinds of  shrubbery what should the organism assume about other shurbbery, vegetation or its  spatial density? In an pattern recognition context, given a character of a certain shape,  orientation, noise level etc.. has been recognized correctly what should the system  assume about other shapes, orientations, noise levels it has yet to encounter?

In addition, in  this  framework  the  problem of learning  is equivalent to the problem of reversing the time course of a diffusion pro(cid:173) cess.

1  LEARNING WITH LOCALIZED RECEPTIVE FIELDS 
Locally-tuned  representations  are  common in  both  biological  and  artificial  neural  networks.  Several workers have analyzed the effect of receptive field  size, shape, and  overlap  on  representation  accuracy:  (Baldi,  1988),  (Ballard,  1987),  and  (Hinton,  1986).  This paper investigates the additional interactions introduced by  the task of  function learning.  Previous studies which have considered learning have for the most  part restricted attention to the use of the input probability distribution to determine  receptive field  layout (Kohonen,  1984)  and (Moody and Darken,  1989).  We  will see  that the structure of the function  being learned may also  be  advantageously taken  into account. 
Function learning using  radial basis functions  (RBF's)  is  currently  a  popular tech(cid:173) nique  (Broomhead  and  Lowe,  1988)  and  serves  as  an  adequate framework  for  our  discussion.  Because  we  are interested  in constraints on biological systems,  we  must  explictly  consider  the  effects  of unit  noise.  The  goal  is  to  choose  the  layout  of  receptive fields  so as  to minimize average performance error.  Let  y  = f(x)  be  the  function  the  network  is  attempting  to  learn  from  example"

Introduction to Dyna 
Dyna architectures (Sutton, 1990) use learning algorithms to approximate the con(cid:173) ventional optimal control technique known as dynamic programming (DP) (Bell(cid:173) man, 1957; Bertsekas, 1987). DP itself is not a learning method, but rather a  computational method for determining optimal behavior given a complete model of  the task to be solved. It is very similar to state-space search, but differs in that  it is more incremental and never considers actual action sequences explicitly, only  single actions at a time. This makes DP more amenable to incremental planning  at execution time, and also makes it more suitable for stochastic or incompletely  modeled environments, as it need not consider the extremely large number of se(cid:173) quences possible in an uncertain environment. Learned world models are likely  to be stochastic and uncertain, making DP approaches particularly promising for"

Instead the robot receives only sensory  information which is inherently limited. A connectionist architecture is  presented which incorporates a large amount of a priori knowledge in the  form of hard-wired networks, architectural constraints, and initial weights.  Instead of hard-wiring static potential fields from object models, myarchi(cid:173) tecture learns sensor-based potential fields, automatically adjusting them  to avoid local minima and to produce efficient homing trajectories. It does  this without object models using only sensory information. This research  demonstrates the use of a large modular architecture on a difficult task."

Introduction  and Motivation 
In this paper we  examine in a general sense the application of Minimum Description  Length  (MDL)  techniques to the  problem of selecting a  good  classifier from  a  large  set  of candidate models  or  hypotheses.  Pattern recognition  algorithms  differ  from  more  conventional  statistical  modeling  techniques  in  the  sense  that  they  typically  choose from a very large number of candidate models to describe the available data.  Hence,  the  problem of searching  through  this set of candidate models  is  frequently  a  formidable  one, often  approached in practice  by  the use of greedy  algorithms.  In  this context, techniques which allow us to eliminate portions of the hypothesis space  are of considerable interest.  We  will show  in  this paper that it is  possible to use  the  intrinsic  structure of the  MDL  formalism  to eliminate large  numbers  of candidate  models given  only minimal information about  the  data.  Our results  depend  on the"

The  model  suggests  that  all  of these  features  are  interrelated  and  result from lateral inhibition. 
1 SIGNAL PROCESSING IN THE VOR  The  VOR  stabilizes  the  visual  image  by  producing  eye  rotations  that  are  nearly  equal  and  opposite  to  head  rotations  (Wilson  and  Melvill  Jones  1979).  The  VOR  utilizes  head  rotational  velocity  signals,  which  originate  in  the  semicircular canal  receptors of  the  inner  ear,  to  control  contractions  of the  extraocular  muscles.  The  reflex  is  coor(cid:173) dinated by brainstem interneurons in the vestibular nuclei (VN),  that relay  signals from  canal afferent sensory neurons to eye muscle motoneurons.

A Recurrent Neural Network Model of Velocity Storage 
33 
The  VN  intemeurons,  however,  do  more  than just relay  signals.  Among  other func(cid:173) tions,  the  VN neurons process  the  canal afferent signals,  stretching out their time con(cid:173) stants by about four times before transmitting this signal to the motoneurons.  This time  constant  prolongation,  which  is  one  of the  clearest  examples  of signal  processing  in  motor neurophysiology,  has  been  termed velocity  storage  (Raphan  et  al.  1979).  The  neural mechanisms underlying velocity storage, however,  remain unidentified. 
The  VOR is bilaterally  symmetric  (Wilson  and  Melvill Jones  1979).  The semicircular  canals  operate  in  push-pull  pairs,  and  the  extraocular  muscles  are  arranged  in  agonist/antagonist  pairs.  The  VN  are  also  arranged  bilaterally  and  interact  via  in(cid:173) hibitory commissural connections.  The commissures are necessary  for velocity storage,  which is eliminated by cutting the commissures in monkeys (Blair and Gavin  1981). 
When  the  overall  V OR  fails  to  compensate  for  head  rotations,  the visual  image is not  stabilized but moves across the  retina at a velocity  that  is  equal  to  the  amount of VOR  error.  This  'retinal slip'  signal is transmitted back to the  VN,  and is known to  modify  VOR  operation  (Wilson  and  Melvill  Jones  1979).  Thus  the  VOR  can  be  modeled  beautifully as  a  three-layered neural network,  complete with  recurrent connections and  error signal back-propagation at the VN level.  By  modeling  the  VOR  as  a neural  net(cid:173) work,  insight can be gained into the global organization of this reflex.

1  THE THEORY OF GENERALIZATION 
Because we never confront exactly the same situation twice, anything we have learned in  any previous situation can guide us in deciding which action to take in the present situation  only  to  the  extent  that  the  similarity  between  the  two  situations  is  sufficient  to  justify  generalization of our previous learning to the present situation.  Accordingly, principles of  generalization must be foundational for any theory of behavior. 
In  Shepard  (1987)  nonarbitrary principles  of generalization  were  sought that  would  be  optimum in any world in which an object, however distinct from other objects, is generally  a  member of some class or natural kind  sharing some dispositional property of potential  consequence for the individual.

Optimization of information capacity is  constrained by the noise levels of the individual channels and by a penalty  for the construction of long-range interconnections in the array. At low  signal-to-noise ratios the optimal filter characteristics correspond to bound  states of a Schrodinger equation in which the signal spectrum plays the  role of the potential. The resulting optimal filters are remarkably similar  to those observed in the mammalian visual cortex and the retinal ganglion  cells of lower vertebrates. The observed scale invariance of natural images  plays an essential role in this construction.

1 A MODEL FOR COLOR CONSTANCY 
Humans have the remarkable ability to perceive object colors as roughly constant  even if the color of the illumination is varied widely. Edwin Land, founder of the  Polaroid Corporation, models the computation that results in this ability as three  identical center-surround operations performed independently in three color planes,  such as red, green, and blue (Land, 1986). The basis for this model is as follows.

The correspondence problem (finding the correct matches  between the pixels of the epipolar lines of the stereo pair from amongst all  the possible matches) is posed as a non-iterative many-to-one mapping . A  two-layer feed forward NN architecture is developed to learn and code this  nonlinear and complex mapping using the back-propagation learning rule  and a training set. The important aspect of this technique is that none of  the typical constraints such as uniqueness and continuity are explicitly  imposed. All the applicable constraints are learned and internally coded  by the NN enabling it to be more flexible and more accurate than the  existing methods. The approach is successfully tested on several random(cid:173) dot stereograms. It is shown that the net can generalize its learned map(cid:173) ping to cases outside its training set. Advantages over the Marr-Poggio  Algorithm are discussed and it is shown that the NN performance is supe(cid:173) rIOr.

. 
1  TLS  APPLIED  TO  LEARNING DENSITIES 
Recently  a  theory  of learning  has  been  constructed  which  describes  the  learning  of a  relation  from  examples  (Tishby, Levin,  and Sol1a,  1989),  (Schwarb, Samalan,  Sol1a,  and Denker,  1990).  The original derivation  relies  on  a  statistical  mechanics  treatment  of the  probability  of independent  events  in  a  system  with  a  specified  average value of an additive error function. 
The resulting  theory is  not restricted  to learning  relations  and it is  not  essentially  statistical  mechanical.  The TLS  theory  can be derived  from  the  principle  of maz(cid:173) imum  entropy,  a  general  inference  tool which  produces  probabilities  characterized  by certain values of the averages of specified functions(Jaynes,  1979).  A TLS theory  can be  constructed  whenever  the specified  function  is  additive and associated  with  independent examples.  In this paper we treat the problem of learning a  probability  density from samples.  Consider the model as some function p( z Iw) of fixed form and adjustable parameters  w  which are  to be chosen  to approximate 1'(z)  where  the overline denotes  the  true  density.

Fahlman,"Recurrent  Cascade-Correlation  CRCC)  is  a recurrent  version  of the  Cascade(cid:173) Correlation learning architecture of Fah I man and Lebiere [Fahlman, 1990].  RCC  can learn from examples to map a sequence of inputs into a desired sequence of  outputs.  New hidden units with recurrent connections are added to the network  as needed during training.  In effect, the network builds up a finite-state machine  tailored  specifically  for  the current problem.  RCC  retains  the  advantages  of  Cascade-Correlation:  fast learning, good generalization, automatic construction  of a near-minimal multi-layered network, and incremental training. 
1  THE ARCHITECTURE 
Cascade-Correlation  [Fahlman, 1990]  is  a supervised  learning  architecture  that builds  a  near-minimal multi-layer network topology in the course of training.  Initially the network  contains only inputs, output units, and the connections between them.  This single layer of  connections is trained (using the Quickprop algorithm [Fahlman, 1988]) to minimize the  error.  When no further improvement is seen in the level of error, the network's performance  is evaluated.  If the error is small enough, we stop.  Otherwise we add a new hidden unit to  the network in an attempt to reduce the residual error.  To create a new hidden unit, we begin with a pool of candidate units, each of which receives  weighted connections from the network's inputs and from any hidden units already present  in the net.  The outputs of these candidate units are not yet connected into the active network.  Multiple passes through the training set are run, and each candidate unit adjusts its incoming  weights to maximize the correlation between its output and the residual error in the active  net.  When the correlation scores stop improving, we choose the best candidate, freeze  its  incoming weights, and add it to the network.  This process is called ""tenure.""  After tenure,"
